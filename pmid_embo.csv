30478191,"Meiotic resumption-coupled degradation of maternal transcripts occurs during oocyte maturation in the absence of mRNA transcription. The CCR4-NOT complex has been identified as the main eukaryotic mRNA deadenylase. In vivo functional and mechanistic information regarding its multiple subunits remains insufficient. Cnot6l, one of four genes encoding CCR4-NOT catalytic subunits, is preferentially expressed in mouse oocytes. Genetic deletion of Cnot6l impaired deadenylation and degradation of a subset of maternal mRNAs during oocyte maturation. Overtranslation of these undegraded mRNAs caused microtubule-chromosome organization defects, which led to activation of spindle assembly checkpoint and meiotic cell cycle arrest at prometaphase. Consequently, Cnot6l (-/-) female mice were severely subfertile. The function of CNOT6L in maturing oocytes is mediated by RNA-binding protein ZFP36L2, not maternal-to-zygotic transition licensing factor BTG4, which interacts with catalytic subunits CNOT7 and CNOT8 of CCR4-NOT Thus, recruitment of different adaptors by different catalytic subunits ensures stage-specific degradation of maternal mRNAs by CCR4-NOT This study provides the first direct genetic evidence that CCR4-NOT-dependent and particularly CNOT6L-dependent decay of selective maternal mRNAs is a prerequisite for meiotic maturation of oocytes.",CNOT6L couples the selective degradation of maternal transcripts to meiotic cell cycle progression in mouse oocyte.,The EMBO journal

30467221,"The IkappaB kinase (IKK) is considered to control gene expression primarily through activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB. However, we show here that IKK additionally regulates gene expression on post-transcriptional level. IKK interacted with several mRNA-binding proteins, including a Processing (P) body scaffold protein, termed enhancer of decapping 4 (EDC4). IKK bound to and phosphorylated EDC4 in a stimulus-sensitive manner, leading to co-recruitment of P body components, mRNA decapping proteins 1a and 2 (DCP1a and DCP2) and to an increase in P body numbers. Using RNA sequencing, we identified scores of transcripts whose stability was regulated via the IKK-EDC4 axis. Strikingly, in the absence of stimulus, IKK-EDC4 promoted destabilization of pro-inflammatory cytokines and regulators of apoptosis. Our findings expand the reach of IKK beyond its canonical role as a regulator of transcription.",The IkappaB kinase complex is a regulator of mRNA stability.,The EMBO journal

30446598,"A finely tuned balance of self-renewal, differentiation, proliferation, and survival governs the pool size and regenerative capacity of blood-forming hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Here, we report that protein kinase C delta (PKCdelta) is a critical regulator of adult HSPC number and function that couples the proliferative and metabolic activities of HSPCs. PKCdelta-deficient mice showed a pronounced increase in HSPC numbers, increased competence in reconstituting lethally irradiated recipients, enhanced long-term competitive advantage in serial transplantation studies, and an augmented HSPC recovery during stress. PKCdelta-deficient HSPCs also showed accelerated proliferation and reduced apoptosis, but did not exhaust in serial transplant assays or induce leukemia. Using inducible knockout and transplantation models, we further found that PKCdelta acts in a hematopoietic cell-intrinsic manner to restrict HSPC number and bone marrow regenerative function. Mechanistically, PKCdelta regulates HSPC energy metabolism and coordinately governs multiple regulators within signaling pathways implicated in HSPC homeostasis. Together, these data identify PKCdelta as a critical regulator of HSPC signaling and metabolism that acts to limit HSPC expansion in response to physiological and regenerative demands.",Attenuation of PKCdelta enhances metabolic activity and promotes expansion of blood progenitors.,The EMBO journal
30446597,"The E3 ligase parkin ubiquitinates outer mitochondrial membrane proteins during oxidative stress and is linked to early-onset Parkinson's disease. Parkin is autoinhibited but is activated by the kinase PINK1 that phosphorylates ubiquitin leading to parkin recruitment, and stimulates phosphorylation of parkin's N-terminal ubiquitin-like (pUbl) domain. How these events alter the structure of parkin to allow recruitment of an E2~Ub conjugate and enhanced ubiquitination is an unresolved question. We present a model of an E2~Ub conjugate bound to the phospho-ubiquitin-loaded C-terminus of parkin, derived from NMR chemical shift perturbation experiments. We show the UbcH7~Ub conjugate binds in the open state whereby conjugated ubiquitin binds to the RING1/IBR interface. Further, NMR and mass spectrometry experiments indicate the RING0/RING2 interface is re-modelled, remote from the E2 binding site, and this alters the reactivity of the RING2(Rcat) catalytic cysteine, needed for ubiquitin transfer. Our experiments provide evidence that parkin phosphorylation and E2~Ub recruitment act synergistically to enhance a weak interaction of the pUbl domain with the RING0 domain and rearrange the location of the RING2(Rcat) domain to drive parkin activity.",Synergistic recruitment of UbcH7~Ub and phosphorylated Ubl domain triggers parkin activation.,The EMBO journal
30442834,"Tissue invagination drives embryo remodeling and assembly of internal organs during animal development. While the role of actomyosin-mediated apical constriction in initiating inward folding is well established, computational models suggest relaxation of the basal surface as an additional requirement. However, the lack of genetic mutations interfering specifically with basal relaxation has made it difficult to test its requirement during invagination so far. Here we use optogenetics to quantitatively control myosin-II levels at the basal surface of invaginating cells during Drosophila gastrulation. We show that while basal myosin-II is lost progressively during ventral furrow formation, optogenetics allows the maintenance of pre-invagination levels over time. Quantitative imaging demonstrates that optogenetic activation prior to tissue bending slows down cell elongation and blocks invagination. Activation after cell elongation and tissue bending has initiated inhibits cell shortening and folding of the furrow into a tube-like structure. Collectively, these data demonstrate the requirement of myosin-II polarization and basal relaxation throughout the entire invagination process.",Downregulation of basal myosin-II is required for cell shape changes and tissue invagination.,The EMBO journal
30420557,"A set of glutamylases and deglutamylases controls levels of tubulin polyglutamylation, a prominent post-translational modification of neuronal microtubules. Defective tubulin polyglutamylation was first linked to neurodegeneration in the Purkinje cell degeneration (pcd) mouse, which lacks deglutamylase CCP1, displays massive cerebellar atrophy, and accumulates abnormally glutamylated tubulin in degenerating neurons. We found biallelic rare and damaging variants in the gene encoding CCP1 in 13 individuals with infantile-onset neurodegeneration and confirmed the absence of functional CCP1 along with dysregulated tubulin polyglutamylation. The human disease mainly affected the cerebellum, spinal motor neurons, and peripheral nerves. We also demonstrate previously unrecognized peripheral nerve and spinal motor neuron degeneration in pcd mice, which thus recapitulated key features of the human disease. Our findings link human neurodegeneration to tubulin polyglutamylation, entailing this post-translational modification as a potential target for drug development for neurodegenerative disorders.",Loss of tubulin deglutamylase CCP1 causes infantile-onset neurodegeneration.,The EMBO journal
30420556,"Posttranslational modifications of tubulin are emerging regulators of microtubule functions. We have shown earlier that upregulated polyglutamylation is linked to rapid degeneration of Purkinje cells in mice with a mutation in the deglutamylating enzyme CCP1. How polyglutamylation leads to degeneration, whether it affects multiple neuron types, or which physiological processes it regulates in healthy neurons has remained unknown. Here, we demonstrate that excessive polyglutamylation induces neurodegeneration in a cell-autonomous manner and can occur in many parts of the central nervous system. Degeneration of selected neurons in CCP1-deficient mice can be fully rescued by simultaneous knockout of the counteracting polyglutamylase TTLL1. Excessive polyglutamylation reduces the efficiency of neuronal transport in cultured hippocampal neurons, suggesting that impaired cargo transport plays an important role in the observed degenerative phenotypes. We thus establish polyglutamylation as a cell-autonomous mechanism for neurodegeneration that might be therapeutically accessible through manipulation of the enzymes that control this posttranslational modification.",Excessive tubulin polyglutamylation causes neurodegeneration and perturbs neuronal transport.,The EMBO journal
30396994,"Optogenetic tools, providing non-invasive control over selected cells, have the potential to revolutionize sensory prostheses for humans. Optogenetic stimulation of spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) in the ear provides a future alternative to electrical stimulation used in cochlear implants. However, most channelrhodopsins do not support the high temporal fidelity pertinent to auditory coding because they require milliseconds to close after light-off. Here, we biophysically characterized the fast channelrhodopsin Chronos and revealed a deactivation time constant of less than a millisecond at body temperature. In order to enhance neural expression, we improved its trafficking to the plasma membrane (Chronos-ES/TS). Following efficient transduction of SGNs using early postnatal injection of the adeno-associated virus AAV-PHPB into the mouse cochlea, fiber-based optical stimulation elicited optical auditory brainstem responses (oABR) with minimal latencies of 1 ms, thresholds of 5 muJ and 100 mus per pulse, and sizable amplitudes even at 1,000 Hz of stimulation. Recordings from single SGNs demonstrated good temporal precision of light-evoked spiking.

30389669,"The Arabidopsis PIF4 and BES1/BZR1 transcription factors antagonize light signaling by facilitating co-activated expression of a large number of cell wall-loosening and auxin-related genes. While PIF4 directly activates expression of these targets, BES1 and BZR1 activity switch from a repressive to an activator function, depending on interaction with TOPLESS and other families of regulators including PIFs. However, the complexity of this regulation and its role in diurnal control of plant growth and brassinosteroid (BR) levels is little understood. We show by using a protein array that BES1, PIF4, and the BES1-PIF4 complex recognize different DNA elements, thus revealing a distinctive cis-regulatory code beneath BES1-repressive and PIF4 co-activation function. BES1 homodimers bind to conserved BRRE- and G-box elements in the BR biosynthetic promoters and inhibit their expression during the day, while elevated PIF4 competes for BES1 homodimer formation, resulting in de-repressed BR biosynthesis at dawn and in response to warmth. Our findings demonstrate a central role of PIF4 in BR synthesis activation, increased BR levels being essential to thermomorphogenic hypocotyl growth.",PIF4-induced BR synthesis is critical to diurnal and thermomorphogenic growth.,The EMBO journal

30389666,"While mucosal inflammation is a major source of stress during enteropathogen infection, it remains to be fully elucidated how the host benefits from this environment to clear the pathogen. Here, we show that host stress induced by different stimuli mimicking inflammatory conditions strongly reduces the binding of Shigella flexneri to epithelial cells. Mechanistically, stress activates acid sphingomyelinase leading to host membrane remodeling. Consequently, knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of the acid sphingomyelinase blunts the stress-dependent inhibition of Shigella binding to host cells. Interestingly, stress caused by intracellular Shigella replication also results in remodeling of the host cell membrane, in vitro and in vivo, which precludes re-infection by this and other non-motile pathogens. In contrast, Salmonella Typhimurium overcomes the shortage of permissive entry sites by gathering effectively at the remaining platforms through its flagellar motility. Overall, our findings reveal host membrane remodeling as a novel stress-responsive cell-autonomous defense mechanism that protects epithelial cells from infection by non-motile bacterial pathogens.",Stress-induced host membrane remodeling protects from infection by non-motile bacterial pathogens.,The EMBO journal
30389665,"Fibroblast growth factor 21 (Fgf21) is a liver-derived, fasting-induced hormone with broad effects on growth, nutrient metabolism, and insulin sensitivity. Here, we report the discovery of a novel mechanism regulating Fgf21 expression under growth and fasting-feeding. The Sel1L-Hrd1 complex is the most conserved branch of mammalian endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD) machinery. Mice with liver-specific deletion of Sel1L exhibit growth retardation with markedly elevated circulating Fgf21, reaching levels close to those in Fgf21 transgenic mice or pharmacological models. Mechanistically, we show that the Sel1L-Hrd1 ERAD complex controls Fgf21 transcription by regulating the ubiquitination and turnover (and thus nuclear abundance) of ER-resident transcription factor Crebh, while having no effect on the other well-known Fgf21 transcription factor Pparalpha. Our data reveal a physiologically regulated, inverse correlation between Sel1L-Hrd1 ERAD and Crebh-Fgf21 levels under fasting-feeding and growth. This study not only establishes the importance of Sel1L-Hrd1 ERAD in the liver in the regulation of systemic energy metabolism, but also reveals a novel hepatic ""ERAD-Crebh-Fgf21"" axis directly linking ER protein turnover to gene transcription and systemic metabolic regulation.",Hepatic Sel1L-Hrd1 ER-associated degradation (ERAD) manages FGF21 levels and systemic metabolism via CREBH.,The EMBO journal
30389664,"The endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation (ERAD) is responsible for recognizing and retro-translocating protein substrates, misfolded or not, from the ER for cytosolic proteasomal degradation. HMG-CoA Reductase (HMGCR) Degradation protein-HRD1-was initially identified as an E3 ligase critical for ERAD. However, its physiological functions remain largely undefined. Herein, we discovered that hepatic HRD1 expression is induced in the postprandial condition upon mouse refeeding. Mice with liver-specific HRD1 deletion failed to repress FGF21 production in serum and liver even in the refeeding condition and phenocopy the FGF21 gain-of-function mice showing growth retardation, female infertility, and diurnal circadian behavior disruption. HRD1-ERAD facilitates the degradation of the liver-specific ER-tethered transcription factor CREBH to downregulate FGF21 expression.

30389661,"Nutrient overload in combination with decreased energy dissipation promotes obesity and diabetes. Obesity results in a hormonal imbalance, which among others activates G protein-coupled receptors utilizing diacylglycerol (DAG) as secondary messenger. Protein kinase D1 (PKD1) is a DAG effector, which integrates multiple nutritional and hormonal inputs, but its physiological role in adipocytes is unknown. Here, we show that PKD1 promotes lipogenesis and suppresses mitochondrial fragmentation, biogenesis, respiration, and energy dissipation in an AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-dependent manner. Moreover, mice lacking PKD1 in adipocytes are resistant to diet-induced obesity due to elevated energy expenditure. Beiging of adipocytes promotes energy expenditure and counteracts obesity. Consistently, deletion of PKD1 promotes expression of the beta3-adrenergic receptor (ADRB3) in a CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP)-alpha- and delta-dependent manner, which leads to the elevated expression of beige markers in adipocytes and subcutaneous adipose tissue. Finally, deletion of PKD1 in adipocytes improves insulin sensitivity and ameliorates liver steatosis. Thus, depletion of PKD1 in adipocytes increases energy dissipation by several complementary mechanisms and might represent an attractive strategy to treat obesity and its related complications.",Protein kinase D1 deletion in adipocytes enhances energy dissipation and protects against adiposity.,The EMBO journal

30373810,"Focal deletions occur frequently in the cancer genome. However, the putative tumor-suppressive genes residing within these regions have been difficult to pinpoint. To robustly identify these genes, we implemented a computational approach based on non-negative matrix factorization, NMF, and interrogated the TCGA dataset. This analysis revealed a metagene signature including a small subset of genes showing pervasive hemizygous deletions, reduced expression in cancer patient samples, and nucleolar function. Amid the genes belonging to this signature, we have identified PNRC1, a nuclear receptor coactivator. We found that PNRC1 interacts with the cytoplasmic DCP1alpha/DCP2 decapping machinery and hauls it inside the nucleolus. PNRC1-dependent nucleolar translocation of the decapping complex is associated with a decrease in the 5'-capped U3 and U8 snoRNA fractions, hampering ribosomal RNA maturation. As a result, PNRC1 ablates the enhanced proliferation triggered by established oncogenes such as RAS and MYC These observations uncover a previously undescribed mechanism of tumor suppression, whereby the cytoplasmic decapping machinery is hauled within nucleoli, tightly regulating ribosomal RNA maturation.",Tumor suppressor PNRC1 blocks rRNA maturation by recruiting the decapping complex to the nucleolus.,The EMBO journal

30348864,"The mechanisms of mitochondrial dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease are incompletely understood. Using two-photon fluorescence lifetime microscopy of the coenzymes, NADH and NADPH, and tracking brain oxygen metabolism with multi-parametric photoacoustic microscopy, we show that activation of lysosomal mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) by insulin or amino acids stimulates mitochondrial activity and regulates mitochondrial DNA synthesis in neurons. Amyloid-beta oligomers, which are precursors of amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease brain and stimulate mTORC1 protein kinase activity at the plasma membrane but not at lysosomes, block this Nutrient-induced Mitochondrial Activity (NiMA) by a mechanism dependent on tau, which forms neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease brain. NiMA was also disrupted in fibroblasts derived from two patients with tuberous sclerosis complex, a genetic disorder that causes dysregulation of lysosomal mTORC1. Thus, lysosomal mTORC1 couples nutrient availability to mitochondrial activity and links mitochondrial dysfunction to Alzheimer's disease by a mechanism dependent on the soluble building blocks of the poorly soluble plaques and tangles.",A novel lysosome-to-mitochondria signaling pathway disrupted by amyloid-beta oligomers.,The EMBO journal

While many modulators of Hippo activity have been identified, little is known about the Yap target genes that mediate these growth effects. Here, we show that yap (-/-) mutant zebrafish exhibit defects in hepatic progenitor potential and liver growth due to impaired glucose transport and nucleotide biosynthesis. Transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses reveal that Yap regulates expression of glucose transporter glut1, causing decreased glucose uptake and use for nucleotide biosynthesis in yap (-/-) mutants, and impaired glucose tolerance in adults. Nucleotide supplementation improves Yap deficiency phenotypes, indicating functional importance of glucose-fueled nucleotide biosynthesis. Yap-regulated glut1 expression and glucose uptake are conserved in mammals, suggesting that stimulation of anabolic glucose metabolism is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism by which the Hippo pathway controls organ growth. Together, our results reveal a central role for Hippo signaling in glucose metabolic homeostasis.",Yap regulates glucose utilization and sustains nucleotide synthesis to enable organ growth.,The EMBO journal
30322896,"Unlike the WASP family of Arp2/3 complex activators, WISH/DIP/SPIN90 (WDS) family proteins activate actin filament nucleation by the Arp2/3 complex without the need for a preformed actin filament. This allows WDS proteins to initiate branched actin network assembly by providing seed filaments that activate WASP-bound Arp2/3 complex. Despite their important role in actin network initiation, it is unclear how WDS proteins drive the activating steps that require both WASP and pre-existing actin filaments during WASP-mediated nucleation. Here, we show that SPIN90 folds into an armadillo repeat domain that binds a surface of Arp2/3 complex distinct from the two WASP sites, straddling a hinge point that may stimulate movement of the Arp2 subunit into the activated short-pitch conformation. SPIN90 binds a surface on Arp2/3 complex that overlaps with actin filament binding, explaining how it could stimulate the same structural rearrangements in the complex as pre-existing actin filaments. By revealing how WDS proteins activate the Arp2/3 complex, these data provide a molecular foundation to understand initiation of dendritic actin networks and regulation of Arp2/3 complex by its activators.",Structure of the nucleation-promoting factor SPIN90 bound to the actin filament nucleator Arp2/3 complex.,The EMBO journal
30322894,"Metabolic reprogramming has been described in rapidly growing tumors, which are thought to mostly contain fast-cycling cells (FCCs) that have impaired mitochondrial function and rely on aerobic glycolysis. Here, we characterize the metabolic landscape of glioblastoma (GBM) and explore metabolic specificities as targetable vulnerabilities. Our studies highlight the metabolic heterogeneity in GBM, in which FCCs harness aerobic glycolysis, and slow-cycling cells (SCCs) preferentially utilize mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation for their functions. SCCs display enhanced invasion and chemoresistance, suggesting their important role in tumor recurrence. SCCs also demonstrate increased lipid contents that are specifically metabolized under glucose-deprived conditions. Fatty acid transport in SCCs is targetable by pharmacological inhibition or genomic deletion of FABP7, both of which sensitize SCCs to metabolic stress. Furthermore, FABP7 inhibition, whether alone or in combination with glycolysis inhibition, leads to overall increased survival. Our studies reveal the existence of GBM cell subpopulations with distinct metabolic requirements and suggest that FABP7 is central to lipid metabolism in SCCs and that targeting FABP7-related metabolic pathways is a viable therapeutic strategy.",Infiltrative and drug-resistant slow-cycling cells support metabolic heterogeneity in glioblastoma.,The EMBO journal
30314966,"Although lysosomes perform a number of essential cellular functions, damaged lysosomes represent a potential hazard to the cell. Such lysosomes are therefore engulfed by autophagic membranes in the process known as lysophagy, which is initiated by recognition of luminal glycoprotein domains by cytosolic lectins such as Galectin-3. Here, we show that, under various conditions that cause injury to the lysosome membrane, components of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT)-I, ESCRT-II, and ESCRT-III are recruited. This recruitment occurs before that of Galectin-3 and the lysophagy machinery. Subunits of the ESCRT-III complex show a particularly prominent recruitment, which depends on the ESCRT-I component TSG101 and the TSG101- and ESCRT-III-binding protein ALIX Interference with ESCRT recruitment abolishes lysosome repair and causes otherwise reversible lysosome damage to become cell lethal. Vacuoles containing the intracellular pathogen Coxiella burnetii show reversible ESCRT recruitment, and interference with this recruitment reduces intravacuolar bacterial replication. We conclude that the cell is equipped with an endogenous mechanism for lysosome repair which protects against lysosomal damage-induced cell death but which also provides a potential advantage for intracellular pathogens.",ESCRT-mediated lysosome repair precedes lysophagy and promotes cell survival.,The EMBO journal
30305303,"Separase halves eukaryotic chromosomes in M-phase by cleaving cohesin complexes holding sister chromatids together. Whether this essential protease functions also in interphase and/or impacts carcinogenesis remains largely unknown. Here, we show that mammalian separase is recruited to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) where it is activated to locally cleave cohesin and facilitate homology-directed repair (HDR). Inactivating phosphorylation of its NES, arginine methylation of its RG-repeats, and sumoylation redirect separase from the cytosol to DSBs. In vitro assays suggest that DNA damage response-relevant ATM, PRMT1, and Mms21 represent the corresponding kinase, methyltransferase, and SUMO ligase, respectively. SEPARASE heterozygosity not only debilitates HDR but also predisposes primary embryonic fibroblasts to neoplasia and mice to chemically induced skin cancer. Thus, tethering of separase to DSBs and confined cohesin cleavage promote DSB repair in G2 cells.

The vascular endothelial cadherin, VE-cadherin, mediates endothelial adhesion and is indispensible for blood vessel development and permeability regulation.

During development, VE-cadherin deletion in lymphatic endothelial cells resulted in abortive lymphangiogenesis, edema, and prenatal death. Unexpectedly, inducible postnatal or adult deletion elicited vessel bed-specific responses. Mature dermal lymph vessels resisted VE-cadherin loss and maintained button junctions, which was associated with an upregulation of junctional molecules. Very different, mesenteric lymphatic collectors deteriorated and formed a strongly hyperplastic layer of lymphatic endothelial cells on the mesothelium. This massive hyperproliferation may have been favored by high mesenteric VEGF-C expression and was associated with VEGFR-3 phosphorylation and upregulation of the transcriptional activator TAZ Finally, intestinal lacteals fragmented into cysts or became highly distended possibly as a consequence of the mesenteric defects.

We used affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry and an improved data analysis protocol to characterize the composition and dynamics of yeast NMD complexes in yeast (112 experiments). Unexpectedly, we identified two distinct complexes associated with Upf1: Upf1-23 (Upf1, Upf2, Upf3) and Upf1-decapping Upf1-decapping contained the mRNA decapping enzyme, together with Nmd4 and Ebs1, two proteins that globally affected NMD and were critical for RNA degradation mediated by the Upf1 C-terminal helicase region.

Here, we purify ESCs with distinct TF expression levels from LIF/FCS cultures to uncover early events during commitment from naive pluripotency. ESCs carrying fluorescent Nanog and Esrrb reporters show Esrrb downregulation only in Nanog(low) cells. Independent Esrrb reporter lines demonstrate that Esrrb(negative) ESCs cannot effectively self-renew. Upon Esrrb loss, pre-implantation pluripotency gene expression collapses. ChIP-Seq identifies different regulatory element classes that bind both OCT4 and NANOG in Esrrb(positive) cells. Class I elements lose NANOG and OCT4 binding in Esrrb(negative) ESCs and associate with genes expressed preferentially in naive ESCs.

The impact of these mutations on CDKL5 function is poorly understood because the substrates and cellular processes controlled by CDKL5 are unclear. Here, we describe a quantitative phosphoproteomic screening which identified MAP1S, CEP131 and DLG5-regulators of microtubule and centrosome function-as cellular substrates of CDKL5. Antibodies against MAP1S phospho-Ser(900) and CEP131 phospho-Ser(35) confirmed CDKL5-dependent phosphorylation of these targets in human cells. The phospho-acceptor serine residues in MAP1S, CEP131 and DLG5 lie in the motif RPXSA, although CDKL5 can tolerate residues other than Ala immediately C-terminal to the phospho-acceptor serine. We provide insight into the control of CDKL5 activity and show that pathogenic mutations in CDKL5 cause a major reduction in CDKL5 activity in vitro and in cells.

Using chemical genetics, we found that CDKL5 phosphorylates three microtubule-associated proteins: MAP1S, EB2 and ARHGEF2, and determined the phosphorylation sites. Substrate phosphorylations are greatly reduced in CDKL5 knockout mice, verifying these as physiological substrates. In CDKL5 knockout mouse neurons, dendritic microtubules have longer EB3-labelled plus-end growth duration and these altered dynamics are rescued by reduction of MAP1S levels through shRNA expression, indicating that CDKL5 regulates microtubule dynamics via phosphorylation of MAP1S. We show that phosphorylation by CDKL5 is required for MAP1S dissociation from microtubules. Additionally, anterograde cargo trafficking is compromised in CDKL5 knockout mouse dendrites. Finally, EB2 phosphorylation is reduced in patient-derived human neurons.

With this, we unravel the ligand dependences that drive conformational changes in both domains. Furthermore, we observe intrinsic conformational dynamics in the absence of ATP and ligand in the NBDs. ATP binding and hydrolysis on the other hand can be observed via NBD conformational dynamics. We believe that the progress made here in combination with future studies will facilitate full understanding of ABC transport cycles.",Conformational dynamics of the ABC transporter McjD seen by single-molecule FRET.,The EMBO journal
30237312,"PGAM5, a mitochondrial protein phosphatase that is genetically and biochemically linked to PINK1, facilitates mitochondrial division by dephosphorylating the mitochondrial fission factor Drp1. At the onset of mitophagy, PGAM5 is cleaved by PARL, a rhomboid protease that degrades PINK1 in healthy cells, and the cleaved form facilitates the engulfment of damaged mitochondria by autophagosomes by dephosphorylating the mitophagy receptor FUNDC1. Here, we show that the function and localization of PGAM5 are regulated by syntaxin 17 (Stx17), a mitochondria-associated membrane/mitochondria protein implicated in mitochondrial dynamics in fed cells and autophagy in starved cells. In healthy cells, loss of Stx17 causes PGAM5 aggregation within mitochondria and thereby failure of the dephosphorylation of Drp1, leading to mitochondrial elongation. In Parkin-mediated mitophagy, Stx17 is prerequisite for PGAM5 to interact with FUNDC1. Our results reveal that the Stx17-PGAM5 axis plays pivotal roles in mitochondrial division and PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy.",Syntaxin 17 regulates the localization and function of PGAM5 in mitochondrial division and mitophagy.,The EMBO journal

Nevertheless, biallelic loss of function of TSC1 or TSC2 is rarely found in malignant tumors. Here, we show that TSC1/2 is highly expressed in Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines and patient samples of human Burkitt's lymphoma, a prototypical MYC-driven cancer. Mechanistically, we show that MYC induces TSC1 expression by transcriptional activation of the TSC1 promoter and repression of miR-15a. TSC1 knockdown results in elevated mTORC1-dependent mitochondrial respiration enhanced ROS production and apoptosis. Moreover, TSC1 deficiency attenuates tumor growth in a xenograft mouse model. Our study reveals a novel role for TSC1 in securing homeostasis between MYC and mTORC1 that is required for cell survival and tumor maintenance in Burkitt's lymphoma.

30217955,"Uncontrolled cell division is a hallmark of cancer. Deregulation of Wnt components has been linked to aberrant cell division by multiple mechanisms, including Wnt-mediated stabilisation of proteins signalling, which was notably observed in mitosis. Analysis of Wnt components revealed an unexpected role of B-cell CLL/lymphoma 9 (BCL9) in maintaining mitotic Wnt signalling to promote precise cell division and growth of cancer cell. Mitotic interactome analysis revealed a mechanistic role of BCL9 in inhibiting clathrin-mediated degradation of LRP6 signalosome components by interacting with clathrin and the components in Wnt destruction complex; this function was further controlled by CDK1-driven phosphorylation of BCL9 N-terminal, especially T172. Interestingly, T172 phosphorylation was correlated with cancer patient prognosis and enriched in tumours. Thus, our results revealed a novel role of BCL9 in controlling mitotic Wnt signalling to promote cell division and growth.",CDK1-mediated BCL9 phosphorylation inhibits clathrin to promote mitotic Wnt signalling.,The EMBO journal
30209241,"Nutrient restriction reprograms cellular signaling and metabolic network to shape cancer phenotype. Lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) has a key role in aerobic glycolysis (the Warburg effect) through regeneration of the electron acceptor NAD(+) and is widely regarded as a desirable target for cancer therapeutics. However, the mechanisms of cellular response and adaptation to LDHA inhibition remain largely unknown. Here, we show that LDHA activity supports serine and aspartate biosynthesis. Surprisingly, however, LDHA inhibition fails to impact human melanoma cell proliferation, survival, or tumor growth. Reduced intracellular serine and aspartate following LDHA inhibition engage GCN2-ATF4 signaling to initiate an expansive pro-survival response. This includes the upregulation of glutamine transporter SLC1A5 and glutamine uptake, with concomitant build-up of essential amino acids, and mTORC1 activation, to ameliorate the effects of LDHA inhibition. Tumors with low LDHA expression and melanoma patients acquiring resistance to MAPK signaling inhibitors, which target the Warburg effect, exhibit altered metabolic gene expression reminiscent of the ATF4-mediated survival signaling. ATF4-controlled survival mechanisms conferring synthetic vulnerability to the approaches targeting the Warburg effect offer efficacious therapeutic strategies.",Targeting the Warburg effect via LDHA inhibition engages ATF4 signaling for cancer cell survival.,The EMBO journal

However, neither the signaling axis linking hypothalamic activation to delayed and lasting noradrenergic excitability nor the molecular cascade gating noradrenaline synthesis is defined. Here, we show that hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone-releasing neurons innervate ependymal cells of the 3(rd) ventricle to induce ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) release for transport through the brain's aqueductal system. CNTF binding to its cognate receptors on norepinephrinergic neurons in the locus coeruleus then initiates sequential phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and tyrosine hydroxylase with the Ca(2+)-sensor secretagogin ensuring activity dependence in both rodent and human brains. Both CNTF and secretagogin ablation occlude stress-induced cortical norepinephrine synthesis, ensuing neuronal excitation and behavioral stereotypes. Cumulatively, we identify a multimodal pathway that is rate-limited by CNTF volume transmission and poised to directly convert hypothalamic activation into long-lasting cortical excitability following acute stress.",Hypothalamic CNTF volume transmission shapes cortical noradrenergic excitability upon acute stress.,The EMBO journal

WM regions with polySer aggregates show demyelination and axonal degeneration in SCA8 human and mouse brains. Additionally, knockdown of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF3F in cells reduces steady-state levels of SCA8 polySer and other RAN proteins.

Excitatory hippocampal and inhibitory striatal neurons in vitro have a similar DCV density, and thalamo-cortical axons in vivo have a slightly higher density. Synapses contain on average two to three DCVs, at the periphery of synaptic vesicle clusters. DCVs distribute equally in axons and dendrites, but the vast majority (80%) of DCV fusion events occur at axons. The release probability of DCVs is 1-6%, depending on the stimulation.

Growing evidence indicates that ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation is critical for the differentiation of MSCs and bone formation; however, the function of ubiquitin-specific proteases, the largest subfamily of deubiquitylases, remains unclear. Here, we identify USP34 as a previously unknown regulator of osteogenesis. The expression of USP34 in human MSCs increases after osteogenic induction while depletion of USP34 inhibits osteogenic differentiation. Conditional knockout of Usp34 from MSCs or pre-osteoblasts leads to low bone mass in mice. Deletion of Usp34 also blunts BMP2-induced responses and impairs bone regeneration. Mechanically, we demonstrate that USP34 stabilizes both Smad1 and RUNX2 and that depletion of Smurf1 restores the osteogenic potential of Usp34-deficient MSCs in vitro Taken together, our data indicate that USP34 is required for osteogenic differentiation and bone formation.",Ubiquitin-specific protease USP34 controls osteogenic differentiation and bone formation by regulating BMP2 signaling.,The EMBO journal
30177573,"Newly synthesised histones are thought to dimerise in the cytosol and undergo nuclear import in complex with histone chaperones. Here, we provide evidence that human H3.1 and H4 are imported into the nucleus as monomers. Using a tether-and-release system to study the import dynamics of newly synthesised histones, we find that cytosolic H3.1 and H4 can be maintained as stable monomeric units. Cytosolically tethered histones are bound to importin-alpha proteins (predominantly IPO4), but not to histone-specific chaperones NASP, ASF1a, RbAp46 (RBBP7) or HAT1, which reside in the nucleus in interphase cells. Release of monomeric histones from their cytosolic tether results in rapid nuclear translocation, IPO4 dissociation and incorporation into chromatin at sites of replication. Quantitative analysis of histones bound to individual chaperones reveals an excess of H3 specifically associated with sNASP, suggesting that NASP maintains a soluble, monomeric pool of H3 within the nucleus and may act as a nuclear receptor for newly imported histone. In summary, we propose that histones H3 and H4 are rapidly imported as monomeric units, forming heterodimers in the nucleus rather than the cytosol.",Evidence for the nuclear import of histones H3.1 and H4 as monomers.,The EMBO journal

While human UCP1 mRNA exists in a long form only, alternative polyadenylation creates two different isoforms in mice with 10% of UCP1 mRNA found in the long form (Ucp1L) and ~90% in the short form (Ucp1S). We generated a mouse model expressing only Ucp1S and found that it showed impaired thermogenesis due to a 60% drop in UCP1 protein levels, suggesting that Ucp1L is more efficiently translated than Ucp1S. In addition, we found that beta3 adrenergic receptor signaling promoted the translation of mouse Ucp1L and human Ucp1 in a manner dependent on cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein 2 (CPEB2). CPEB2-knockout mice showed reduced UCP1 levels and impaired thermogenesis in BAT, which was rescued by ectopic expression of CPEB2.

Chronic environmental stress and elevated glucocorticoids (GC), the major stress hormones, are associated with increased risk of AD and have been shown to trigger intracellular Tau accumulation and downstream Tau-dependent neuronal dysfunction. However, the mechanisms through which stress and GC disrupt Tau clearance and degradation in neurons remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that Tau undergoes degradation via endolysosomal sorting in a pathway requiring the small GTPase Rab35 and the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery. Furthermore, we find that GC impair Tau degradation by decreasing Rab35 levels, and that AAV-mediated expression of Rab35 in the hippocampus rescues GC-induced Tau accumulation and related neurostructural deficits.

We showed that the ubiquitin ligase function of CRL4(AMBRA)(1) is required to disrupt the assembly and attenuate the ligase activity of human CRL5(SOCS)(3) and HIV-1 CRL5(VIF) complexes as AMBRA1 depletion leads to hyperactivation of both CRL5 complexes.

We showed that repression of HNRNPC in the breast cancer cells MCF7 and T47D inhibited cell proliferation and tumor growth. Our computational inference of the key pathways and extensive experimental investigations revealed that the cascade of interferon responses mediated by RIG-I was responsible for such tumor-inhibitory effect. Interestingly, repression of HNRNPC resulted in accumulation of endogenous double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), the binding ligand of RIG-I. These up-regulated dsRNA species were highly enriched by Alu sequences and mostly originated from pre-mRNA introns that harbor the known HNRNPC binding sites. Such source of dsRNA is different than the recently well-characterized endogenous retroviruses that encode dsRNA In summary, essentialness of HNRNPC in the breast cancer cells was attributed to its function in controlling the endogenous dsRNA and the down-stream interferon response.

30158111,"The S-phase checkpoint maintains the integrity of the genome in response to DNA replication stress. In budding yeast, this pathway is initiated by Mec1 and is amplified through the activation of Rad53 by two checkpoint mediators: Mrc1 promotes Rad53 activation at stalled forks, and Rad9 is a general mediator of the DNA damage response. Here, we have investigated the interplay between Mrc1 and Rad9 in response to DNA damage and found that they control DNA replication through two distinct but complementary mechanisms. Mrc1 rapidly activates Rad53 at stalled forks and represses late-firing origins but is unable to maintain this repression over time. Rad9 takes over Mrc1 to maintain a continuous checkpoint signaling. Importantly, the Rad9-mediated activation of Rad53 slows down fork progression, supporting the view that the S-phase checkpoint controls both the initiation and the elongation of DNA replication in response to DNA damage. Together, these data indicate that Mrc1 and Rad9 play distinct functions that are important to ensure an optimal completion of S phase under replication stress conditions.",Mrc1 and Rad9 cooperate to regulate initiation and elongation of DNA replication in response to DNA damage.,The EMBO journal

DNA repair pathway choice is governed by the opposing activities of 53BP1, in complex with its effectors RIF1 and REV7, and BRCA1. However, it remains unknown how the 53BP1/RIF1/REV7 complex stimulates NHEJ and restricts HR to the S/G2 phases of the cell cycle. Using a mass spectrometry (MS)-based approach, we identify 11 high-confidence REV7 interactors and elucidate the role of SHLD2 (previously annotated as FAM35A and RINN2) as an effector of REV7 in the NHEJ pathway. FAM35A depletion impairs NHEJ-mediated DNA repair and compromises antibody diversification by class switch recombination (CSR) in B cells. FAM35A accumulates at DSBs in a 53BP1-, RIF1-, and REV7-dependent manner and antagonizes HR by limiting DNA end resection. In fact, FAM35A is part of a larger complex composed of REV7 and SHLD1 (previously annotated as C20orf196 and RINN3), which promotes NHEJ and limits HR Together, these results establish SHLD2 as a novel effector of REV7 in controlling the decision-making process during DSB repair.",SHLD2/FAM35A co-operates with REV7 to coordinate DNA double-strand break repair pathway choice.,The EMBO journal

This results from reduced histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) of FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) locus, which encodes a key negative regulator of flowering. SEC activates ARABIDOPSIS HOMOLOG OF TRITHORAX1 (ATX1), a histone lysine methyltransferase (HKMT), through O-GlcNAc modification to augment ATX1-mediated H3K4me3 histone modification at FLC locus. SEC transfers an O-GlcNAc group on Ser947 of ATX1, which resides in the SET domain, thereby activating ATX1.

The underlying molecular mechanisms controlling the turnover of protein aggregates are mostly uncharacterized. Herein, we show that a TRIM family protein, TRIM16, governs the process of stress-induced biogenesis and degradation of protein aggregates. TRIM16 facilitates protein aggregate formation by positively regulating the p62-NRF2 axis. We show that TRIM16 is an integral part of the p62-KEAP1-NRF2 complex and utilizes multiple mechanisms for stabilizing NRF2. Under oxidative and proteotoxic stress conditions, TRIM16 activates ubiquitin pathway genes and p62 via NRF2, leading to ubiquitination of misfolded proteins and formation of protein aggregates. We further show that TRIM16 acts as a scaffold protein and, by interacting with p62, ULK1, ATG16L1, and LC3B, facilitates autophagic degradation of protein aggregates. Thus, TRIM16 streamlines the process of stress-induced aggregate clearance and protects cells against oxidative/proteotoxic stress-induced toxicity in vitro and in vivo Taken together, this work identifies a new mechanism of protein aggregate turnover, which could be relevant in protein aggregation-associated diseases such as neurodegeneration.",TRIM16 controls assembly and degradation of protein aggregates by modulating the p62-NRF2 axis and autophagy.,The EMBO journal

Synthetic ligands have been used to disentangle the underlying signaling pathways. The adaptor protein AP3 is necessary to transport molecular complexes of TLRs, synthetic CpG DNA, and MyD88 into endosomal compartments allowing interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) recruitment whose phosphorylation then initiates IFN-I production. High basal expression of IRF7 by pDC and its further enhancement by positive IFN-I feedback signaling appear to be necessary for robust cytokine production. In contrast, we show here that in vivo during mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection pDC produce high amounts of IFN-I downstream of the TLR9-to-MyD88-to-IRF7 signaling pathway without requiring IFN-I positive feedback, high IRF7 expression, or AP3-driven endosomal routing of TLRs.

Although theory predicts that fusion pore expansion faces a major energy barrier and might hence be a rate-limiting and regulated step, corresponding states with non-expanding pores are difficult to assay and have remained elusive. Here, we show that vacuoles in living yeast are connected by a metastable, non-expanding, nanoscopic fusion pore. This is their default state, from which full fusion is regulated. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that SNAREs and the SM protein-containing HOPS complex stabilize this pore against re-closure. Expansion of the nanoscopic pore to full fusion can thus be triggered by osmotic pressure gradients, providing a simple mechanism to rapidly adapt organelle volume to increases in its content. Metastable, nanoscopic fusion pores are then not only a transient intermediate but can be a long-lived, physiologically relevant and regulated state of SNARE-dependent membrane fusion.",SNARE-mediated membrane fusion arrests at pore expansion to regulate the volume of an organelle.,The EMBO journal

In budding yeast, template switching (TS) via the Rad18/Rad5 pathway is a favored DDT pathway that involves usage of the sister chromatid as a template to bypass DNA lesions in an error-free recombination-like process. Here, we establish that the Snf2 family translocase Irc5 is a novel factor that promotes TS and averts single-stranded DNA persistence during replication. We demonstrate that, during replication stress, Irc5 enables replication progression by assisting enrichment of cohesin complexes, recruited in an Scc2/Scc4-dependent fashion, near blocked replication forks. This allows efficient formation of sister chromatid junctions that are crucial for error-free DNA lesion bypass. Our results support the notion of a key role of cohesin in the completion of DNA synthesis under replication stress and reveal that the Rad18/Rad5-mediated DDT pathway is linked to cohesin enrichment at sites of perturbed replication via the Snf2 family translocase Irc5.",Error-free DNA damage tolerance pathway is facilitated by the Irc5 translocase through cohesin.,The EMBO journal

How SUV39H1/2 activities are regulated in early embryos and during generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) remains unclear. Since expression of the CRL4 E3 ubiquitin ligase in oocytes is crucial for female fertility, we analyzed putative CRL4 adaptors (DCAFs) and identified DCAF13 as a novel CRL4 adaptor that is essential for preimplantation embryonic development. Dcaf13 is expressed from eight-cell to morula stages in both murine and human embryos, and Dcaf13 knockout in mice causes preimplantation-stage mortality. Dcaf13 knockout embryos are arrested at the eight- to sixteen-cell stage before compaction, and this arrest is accompanied by high levels of H3K9me3. Mechanistically, CRL4-DCAF13 targets SUV39H1 for polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation and therefore facilitates H3K9me3 removal and zygotic gene expression.

Mutation of this motif in budding yeast cells does not affect DNA synthesis, but instead abrogates gene silencing at telomeres and mating-type loci. Similar phenotypes are produced not only by mutations that displace Pol alpha from the replisome, but also by mutation of the previously identified histone-binding motif in the CMG helicase subunit Mcm2, the human orthologue of which was shown to bind to histones H3 and H4. We show that chromatin-derived histone complexes can be bound simultaneously by Mcm2, Pol alpha and the histone chaperone FACT that is also a replisome component.

Editing of the mRNA that encodes actin crosslinking protein Filamin A (FLNA) mediates a Q-to-R transition in the interactive C-terminal region. While FLNA editing is conserved among vertebrates, its physiological function remains unclear. Here, we show that cardiovascular tissues in humans and mice show massive editing and that FLNA RNA is the most prominent substrate. Patient-derived RNA-Seq data demonstrate a significant drop in FLNA editing associated with cardiovascular diseases. Using mice with only impaired FLNA editing, we observed increased vascular contraction and diastolic hypertension accompanied by increased myosin light chain phosphorylation, arterial remodeling, and left ventricular wall thickening, which eventually causes cardiac remodeling and reduced systolic output. These results demonstrate a causal relationship between RNA editing and the development of cardiovascular disease indicating that a single epitranscriptomic RNA modification can maintain cardiovascular health.",RNA editing of Filamin A pre-mRNA regulates vascular contraction and diastolic blood pressure.,The EMBO journal
30076131,"Maintenance of cellular proteostasis relies on efficient clearance of defective gene products. For misfolded secretory proteins, this involves dislocation from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) into the cytosol followed by proteasomal degradation. However, polypeptide aggregation prevents cytosolic dislocation and instead activates ill-defined lysosomal catabolic pathways. Here, we describe an ER-to-lysosome-associated degradation pathway (ERLAD) for proteasome-resistant polymers of alpha1-antitrypsin Z (ATZ). ERLAD involves the ER-chaperone calnexin (CNX) and the engagement of the LC3 lipidation machinery by the ER-resident ER-phagy receptor FAM134B, echoing the initiation of starvation-induced, receptor-mediated ER-phagy. However, in striking contrast to ER-phagy, ATZ polymer delivery from the ER lumen to LAMP1/RAB7-positive endolysosomes for clearance does not require ER capture within autophagosomes. Rather, it relies on vesicular transport where single-membrane, ER-derived, ATZ-containing vesicles release their luminal content within endolysosomes upon membrane:membrane fusion events mediated by the ER-resident SNARE STX17 and the endolysosomal SNARE VAMP8. These results may help explain the lack of benefits of pharmacologic macroautophagy enhancement that has been reported for some luminal aggregopathies.",ER-to-lysosome-associated degradation of proteasome-resistant ATZ polymers occurs via receptor-mediated vesicular transport.,The EMBO journal
30068531,"Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is a secreted lipase that clears triglycerides from the blood. Proper LPL folding and exit from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) require lipase maturation factor 1 (LMF1), an ER-resident transmembrane protein, but the mechanism involved is unknown. We used proteomics to identify LMF1-binding partners necessary for LPL secretion in HEK293 cells and found these to include oxidoreductases and lectin chaperones, suggesting that LMF1 facilitates the formation of LPL's five disulfide bonds. In accordance with this role, we found that LPL aggregates in LMF1-deficient cells due to the formation of incorrect intermolecular disulfide bonds. Cells lacking LMF1 were hypersensitive to depletion of glutathione, but not DTT treatment, suggesting that LMF1 helps reduce the ER Accordingly, we found that loss of LMF1 results in a more oxidized ER Our data show that LMF1 has a broader role than simply folding lipases, and we identified fibronectin and the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) as novel LMF1 clients that contain multiple, non-sequential disulfide bonds. We conclude that LMF1 is needed for secretion of some ER client proteins that require reduction of non-native disulfides during their folding.",Lipase maturation factor 1 affects redox homeostasis in the endoplasmic reticulum.,The EMBO journal

In recent years, numerous causative genes and risk factors for Parkinson's disease have been identified and more than half appear to function at the synapse. Subtle synaptic defects are thought to precede blunt neuronal death, but the mechanisms that are dysfunctional at synapses are only now being unraveled. Here, we review recent work and propose a model where different Parkinson proteins interact in a cell compartment-specific manner at the synapse where these proteins regulate endocytosis and autophagy.

Here, we report that Zika virus (ZIKV) infection triggers NLRP3 inflammasome activation, which is further enhanced by viral non-structural protein NS1 to benefit its replication. NS1 recruits the host deubiquitinase USP8 to cleave K11-linked poly-ubiquitin chains from caspase-1 at Lys134, thus inhibiting the proteasomal degradation of caspase-1. The enhanced stabilization of caspase-1 by NS1 promotes the cleavage of cGAS, which recognizes mitochondrial DNA release and initiates type I IFN signaling during ZIKV infection. NLRP3 deficiency increases type I IFN production and strengthens host resistance to ZIKVin vitro and in vivo Taken together, our work unravels a novel antagonistic mechanism employed by ZIKV to suppress host immune response by manipulating the interplay between inflammasome and type I IFN signaling, which might guide the rational design of therapeutics in the future.",Zika virus elicits inflammation to evade antiviral response by cleaving cGAS via NS1-caspase-1 axis.,The EMBO journal

Replication Protein A (RPA) is an ssDNA-binding protein essential for protecting ssDNA at replication forks in eukaryotic cells. While significant progress has been made in characterizing the role of the RPA-ssDNA complex, how RPA is loaded at replication forks remains poorly explored. Here, we show that the Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein regulator of Ty1 transposition 105 (Rtt105) binds RPA and helps load it at replication forks. Cells lacking Rtt105 exhibit a dramatic reduction in RPA loading at replication forks, compromised DNA synthesis under replication stress, and increased genome instability. Mechanistically, we show that Rtt105 mediates the RPA-importin interaction and also promotes RPA binding to ssDNA directly in vitro, but is not present in the final RPA-ssDNA complex. Single-molecule studies reveal that Rtt105 affects the binding mode of RPA to ssDNA These results support a model in which Rtt105 functions as an RPA chaperone that escorts RPA to the nucleus and facilitates its loading onto ssDNA at replication forks.",Rtt105 functions as a chaperone for replication protein A to preserve genome stability.,The EMBO journal

30061313,"Shoot regeneration can be achieved in vitro through a two-step process involving the acquisition of pluripotency on callus-induction media (CIM) and the formation of shoots on shoot-induction media. Although the induction of root-meristem genes in callus has been noted recently, the mechanisms underlying their induction and their roles in de novo shoot regeneration remain unanswered. Here, we show that the histone acetyltransferase HAG1/AtGCN5 is essential for de novo shoot regeneration. In developing callus, it catalyzes histone acetylation at several root-meristem gene loci including WOX5, WOX14, SCR, PLT1, and PLT2, providing an epigenetic platform for their transcriptional activation. In turn, we demonstrate that the transcription factors encoded by these loci act as key potency factors conferring regeneration potential to callus and establishing competence for de novo shoot regeneration. Thus, our study uncovers key epigenetic and potency factors regulating plant-cell pluripotency. These factors might be useful in reprogramming lineage-specified plant cells to pluripotency.",Epigenetic reprogramming by histone acetyltransferase HAG1/AtGCN5 is required for pluripotency acquisition in Arabidopsis.,The EMBO journal

Here, we reveal a mechanism by which the small GTPase RhoB controls membrane blebbing and blebby amoeboid migration. Interestingly, while all three Rho isoforms (RhoA, RhoB and RhoC) regulated amoeboid migration, each controlled motility in a distinct manner. In particular, RhoB depletion blocked membrane blebbing in ALL (acute lymphoblastic leukaemia), melanoma and lung cancer cells as well as ALL cell amoeboid migration in 3D-collagen, while RhoB overexpression enhanced blebbing and 3D-collagen migration in a manner dependent on its plasma membrane localization and down-stream effectors ROCK and Myosin II RhoB localization was controlled by endosomal trafficking, being internalized via Rab5 vesicles and then trafficked either to late endosomes/lysosomes or to Rab11-positive recycling endosomes, as regulated by KIF13A. Importantly, KIF13A depletion not only inhibited RhoB plasma membrane localization, but also cell membrane blebbing and 3D-migration of ALL cells.

However, Th17 cells are also involved in orchestrating autoimmunity. By employing quantitative surface proteomics, we found that the evolutionarily conserved prohibitins (PHB1/2) are highly expressed on the surface of both murine and human Th17 cells. Increased expression of PHBs at the cell surface contributed to enhanced CRAF/MAPK activation in Th17 cells. Targeting surface-expressed PHBs on Th17 cells with ligands such as Vi polysaccharide (Typhim vaccine) inhibited CRAF-MAPK pathway, reduced interleukin (IL)-17 expression and ameliorated disease pathology with an increase in FOXP3(+)-expressing Tregs in an animal model for multiple sclerosis (MS). Interestingly, we detected a CD4(+) T cell population with high PHB1 surface expression in blood samples from MS patients in comparison with age- and sex-matched healthy subjects.

However, even in the absence of caspase activity, cells usually die following MOMP Such caspase-independent cell death is accompanied by inflammation that requires mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) activation of cGAS-STING signalling. Because the mitochondrial inner membrane is thought to remain intact during apoptosis, we sought to address how matrix mtDNA could activate the cytosolic cGAS-STING signalling pathway. Using super-resolution imaging, we show that mtDNA is efficiently released from mitochondria following MOMP In a temporal manner, we find that following MOMP, BAX/BAK-mediated mitochondrial outer membrane pores gradually widen. This allows extrusion of the mitochondrial inner membrane into the cytosol whereupon it permeablises allowing mtDNA release. Our data demonstrate that mitochondrial inner membrane permeabilisation (MIMP) can occur during cell death following BAX/BAK-dependent MOMP Importantly, by enabling the cytosolic release of mtDNA, inner membrane permeabilisation underpins the immunogenic effects of caspase-independent cell death.",Mitochondrial inner membrane permeabilisation enables mtDNA release during apoptosis.,The EMBO journal
30049711,"Hippocampal GABAergic interneurons are crucial for cortical network function and have been implicated in psychiatric disorders. We show here that Neuregulin 3 (Nrg3), a relatively little investigated low-affinity ligand, is a functionally dominant interaction partner of ErbB4 in parvalbumin-positive (PV) interneurons. Nrg3 and ErbB4 are located pre- and postsynaptically, respectively, in excitatory synapses on PV interneurons in vivo Additionally, we show that ablation of Nrg3 results in a similar phenotype as the one described for ErbB4 ablation, including reduced excitatory synapse numbers on PV interneurons, altered short-term plasticity, and disinhibition of the hippocampal network. In culture, presynaptic Nrg3 increases excitatory synapse numbers on ErbB4(+) interneurons and affects short-term plasticity. Nrg3 mutant neurons are poor donors of presynaptic terminals in the presence of competing neurons that produce recombinant Nrg3, and this bias requires postsynaptic ErbB4 but not ErbB4 kinase activity. Furthermore, when presented by non-neuronal cells, Nrg3 induces postsynaptic membrane specialization.

30049710,"Seipin, the gene that causes Berardinelli-Seip congenital lipodystrophy type 2 (BSCL2), is important for adipocyte differentiation and lipid homeostasis. Previous studies in Drosophila revealed that Seipin promotes ER calcium homeostasis through the Ca(2+)-ATPase SERCA, but little is known about the events downstream of perturbed ER calcium homeostasis that lead to decreased lipid storage in Drosophila dSeipin mutants. Here, we show that glycolytic metabolites accumulate and the downstream mitochondrial TCA cycle is impaired in dSeipin mutants. The impaired TCA cycle further leads to a decreased level of citrate, a critical component of lipogenesis. Mechanistically, Seipin/SERCA-mediated ER calcium homeostasis is important for maintaining mitochondrial calcium homeostasis. Reduced mitochondrial calcium in dSeipin mutants affects the TCA cycle and mitochondrial function. The lipid storage defects in dSeipin mutant fat cells can be rescued by replenishing mitochondrial calcium or by restoring the level of citrate through genetic manipulations or supplementation with exogenous metabolites.

Many pathways have been implicated in regulating HSC development in cell autonomous manners; however, it remains unclear how HSCs sense and integrate developmental cues. In this study, we identified an extrinsic mechanism by which HSC number and functions are regulated during mouse puberty. We found that the HSC number in postnatal bone marrow reached homeostasis at 4 weeks after birth. Luteinizing hormone, but not downstream sex hormones, was involved in regulating HSC homeostasis during this period. Expression of luteinizing hormone receptor (Lhcgr) is highly restricted in HSCs and multipotent progenitor cells in the hematopoietic hierarchy. When Lhcgr was deleted, HSCs continued to expand even after 4 weeks after birth, leading to abnormally elevated hematopoiesis and leukocytosis. In a murine acute myeloid leukemia model, leukemia development was significantly accelerated upon Lhcgr deletion.

Here, we uncover that while YAP is dispensable for homeostatic epidermal regeneration, it is required for BCC development. Our clonal analyses further demonstrate that the few emerging Yap-null dysplasia have lower fitness and thus are diminished as they progress to invasive BCC Mechanistically, YAP depletion in BCC tumors leads to effective impairment of the JNK-JUN signaling, a well-established tumor-driving cascade. Importantly, in this context, YAP does not influence canonical Wnt or Hedgehog signaling.

We map the XIAP binding site on RIPK2 to the loop between beta2 and beta3 of the N-lobe of the kinase, which is in close proximity to the ATP-binding pocket. Through characterization of a new series of ATP pocket-binding RIPK2 inhibitors, we identify the molecular features that determine their inhibition of both the RIPK2-XIAP interaction, and of cellular and in vivoNOD2 signaling.

In most systems, major changes in cell size can be observed during differentiation processes where cells change their volume to adapt their shape to their final function. How relevant changes in cell volume are in driving the differentiation program is a long-standing fundamental question in developmental biology. In the Arabidopsis root meristem, characteristic changes in the size of the distal meristematic cells identify cells that initiated the differentiation program. Here, we show that changes in cell size are essential for the initial steps of cell differentiation and that these changes depend on the concomitant activation by the plant hormone cytokinin of the EXPAs proteins and the AHA1 and AHA2 proton pumps.

The tADs we identify by pooled screening validate in individual luciferase assays, whereas neutral regions do not. Interestingly, the tADs are found at arbitrary positions within the TF sequences and can contain amino acid (e.g., glutamine) repeat regions or overlap structured domains, including helix-loop-helix domains that are typically annotated as DNA-binding. We also identified tADs in the non-native reading frames, confirming that random sequences can function as tADs, albeit weakly.

However, the underlying mechanisms of this regulation remain largely unknown. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the telomere-binding protein Taz1, ortholog of human TRF1/TRF2, regulates a subset of late replication origins by binding to the telomere-like sequence near the origins. Here, we showed using a lacO/LacI-GFP system that Taz1-dependent late origins were predominantly localized at the nuclear periphery throughout interphase, and were localized adjacent to the telomeres in the G1/S phase. The peripheral localization that depended on the nuclear membrane protein Bqt4 was not necessary for telomeric association and replication-timing control of the replication origins. Interestingly, the shelterin components Rap1 and Poz1 were required for replication-timing control and telomeric association of Taz1-dependent late origins, and this requirement was bypassed by a minishelterin Tpz1-Taz1 fusion protein.

We identified the Tip60 chromatin remodeling complex and its interaction partner Myc as regulators of genes required for neuroblast maintenance. Knockdown of Tip60 complex members results in loss of cortical polarity, symmetric neuroblast division, and premature differentiation through nuclear entry of the transcription factor Prospero. We found that aPKC is the key target gene of Myc and the Tip60 complex subunit Domino in regulating neuroblast polarity. Our transcriptome analysis further showed that Domino regulates the expression of mitotic spindle genes previously identified as direct Myc targets.

These persistent dynamics of Foxp3 transcription determine the effector Treg programme and are dependent on a Foxp3 autoregulatory transcriptional circuit. Persistent Foxp3 transcriptional activity controls the expression of coinhibitory molecules, including CTLA-4 and effector Treg signature genes. Using RNA-seq, we identify two groups of surface proteins based on their relationship to the temporal dynamics of Foxp3 transcription, and we show proof of principle for the manipulation of Foxp3 dynamics by immunotherapy: new Foxp3 flux is promoted by anti-TNFRII antibody, and high-frequency Foxp3 expressors are targeted by anti-OX40 antibody.

Here, we show that proteolytic destruction of the key regulator Mcl-1 during an extended mitosis requires the anaphase-promoting complex or cyclosome (APC/C) and is independent of another ubiquitin E3 ligase, SCF(Fbw7) Using live-cell imaging, we show that the loss of Mcl-1 during mitosis is dependent on a D box motif found in other APC/C substrates, while an isoleucine-arginine (IR) C-terminal tail regulates the manner in which Mcl-1 engages with the APC/C, converting Mcl-1 from a Cdc20-dependent and checkpoint-controlled substrate to one that is degraded independently of checkpoint strength. This mechanism ensures a relatively slow but steady rate of Mcl-1 degradation during mitosis and avoids its catastrophic destruction when the mitotic checkpoint is satisfied, providing an apoptotic timer that can distinguish a prolonged mitotic delay from normal mitosis. Importantly, we also show that inhibition of Cdc20 promotes mitotic cell death more effectively than loss of APC/C activity through differential effects on Mcl-1 degradation, providing an improved strategy to kill cancer cells.",Atypical APC/C-dependent degradation of Mcl-1 provides an apoptotic timer during mitotic arrest.,The EMBO journal

Cezanne is remarkably specific for K11-linked ubiquitin chains, which are formed by APC/C in mitosis. Accordingly, Cezanne binds established APC/C substrates and reverses their APC/C-mediated ubiquitination. Cezanne depletion accelerates APC/C substrate degradation and causes errors in mitotic progression and formation of micronuclei. These data highlight the importance of tempered APC/C substrate destruction in maintaining chromosome stability.

An average human genome contains ~100 retrotransposition-competent LINE-1s, whose activity is influenced by the combined action of cellular repressors and activators. TREX1, SAMHD1 and ADAR1 are known LINE-1 repressors and when mutated cause the autoinflammatory disorder Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome (AGS). Mutations in RNase H2 are the most common cause of AGS, and its activity was proposed to similarly control LINE-1 retrotransposition. It has therefore been suggested that increased LINE-1 activity may be the cause of aberrant innate immune activation in AGS Here, we establish that, contrary to expectations, RNase H2 is required for efficient LINE-1 retrotransposition. As RNase H1 overexpression partially rescues the defect in RNase H2 null cells, we propose a model in which RNase H2 degrades the LINE-1 RNA after reverse transcription, allowing retrotransposition to be completed. This also explains how LINE-1 elements can retrotranspose efficiently without their own RNase H activity. Our findings appear to be at odds with LINE-1-derived nucleic acids driving autoinflammation in AGS.","RNase H2, mutated in Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome, promotes LINE-1 retrotransposition.",The EMBO journal
29950310,"Cells sense myriad signals during G1, and a rapid response to prevent cell cycle entry is of crucial importance for proper development and adaptation. Cln3, the most upstream G1 cyclin in budding yeast, is an extremely short-lived protein subject to ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. On the other hand, nuclear accumulation of Cln3 depends on chaperones that are also important for its degradation. However, how these processes are intertwined to control G1-cyclin fate is not well understood. Here, we show that Cln3 undergoes a challenging ubiquitination step required for both degradation and full activation. Segregase Cdc48/p97 prevents degradation of ubiquitinated Cln3, and concurrently stimulates its ER release and nuclear accumulation to trigger Start. Cdc48/p97 phosphorylation at conserved Cdk-target sites is important for recruitment of specific cofactors and, in both yeast and mammalian cells, to attain proper G1-cyclin levels and activity. Cdk-dependent modulation of Cdc48 would subjugate G1 cyclins to fast and reversible state switching, thus arresting cells promptly in G1 at developmental or environmental checkpoints, but also resuming G1 progression immediately after proliferative signals reappear.",Cdc48/p97 segregase is modulated by cyclin-dependent kinase to determine cyclin fate during G1 progression.,The EMBO journal
29950309,"Aged proteins can become hazardous to cellular function, by accumulating molecular damage. This implies that cells should preferentially rely on newly produced ones. We tested this hypothesis in cultured hippocampal neurons, focusing on synaptic transmission. We found that newly synthesized vesicle proteins were incorporated in the actively recycling pool of vesicles responsible for all neurotransmitter release during physiological activity. We observed this for the calcium sensor Synaptotagmin 1, for the neurotransmitter transporter VGAT, and for the fusion protein VAMP2 (Synaptobrevin 2). Metabolic labeling of proteins and visualization by secondary ion mass spectrometry enabled us to query the entire protein makeup of the actively recycling vesicles, which we found to be younger than that of non-recycling vesicles. The young vesicle proteins remained in use for up to ~ 24 h, during which they participated in recycling a few hundred times. They were afterward reluctant to release and were degraded after an additional ~ 24-48 h. We suggest that the recycling pool of synaptic vesicles relies on newly synthesized proteins, while the inactive reserve pool contains older proteins.",Newly produced synaptic vesicle proteins are preferentially used in synaptic transmission.,The EMBO journal

We report that LINE-1 are expressed in substantia nigra ventral midbrain dopaminergic neurons, a class of neurons that degenerate in Parkinson's disease. In Engrailed-1 heterozygotes, these neurons show a progressive degeneration that starts at 6 weeks of age, coinciding with an increase in LINE-1 expression. Similarly, DNA damage and cell death, induced by an acute oxidative stress applied to embryonic midbrain neurons in culture or to adult midbrain dopaminergic neurons in vivo, are accompanied by enhanced LINE-1 expression. Reduction of LINE-1 activity through (i) direct transcriptional repression by Engrailed, (ii) a siRNA directed against LINE-1, (iii) the nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor stavudine, and (iv) viral Piwil1 expression, protects against oxidative stress in vitro and in vivo We thus propose that LINE-1 overexpression triggers oxidative stress-induced DNA strand breaks and that an Engrailed adult function is to protect mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons through the repression of LINE-1 expression.",Engrailed homeoprotein blocks degeneration in adult dopaminergic neurons through LINE-1 repression.,The EMBO journal

29930102,"Chromosome segregation depends on sister chromatid cohesion which is established by cohesin during DNA replication. Cohesive cohesin complexes become acetylated to prevent their precocious release by WAPL before cells have reached mitosis. To obtain insight into how DNA replication, cohesion establishment and cohesin acetylation are coordinated, we analysed the interaction partners of 55 human proteins implicated in these processes by mass spectrometry. This proteomic screen revealed that on chromatin the cohesin acetyltransferase ESCO2 associates with the MCM2-7 subcomplex of the replicative Cdc45-MCM-GINS helicase. The analysis of ESCO2 mutants defective in MCM binding indicates that these interactions are required for proper recruitment of ESCO2 to chromatin, cohesin acetylation during DNA replication, and centromeric cohesion. We propose that MCM binding enables ESCO2 to travel with replisomes to acetylate cohesive cohesin complexes in the vicinity of replication forks so that these complexes can be protected from precocious release by WAPL Our results also indicate that ESCO1 and ESCO2 have distinct functions in maintaining cohesion between chromosome arms and centromeres, respectively.",The replicative helicase MCM recruits cohesin acetyltransferase ESCO2 to mediate centromeric sister chromatid cohesion.,The EMBO journal

Cilia function as signaling centers, but a molecular link to inflammation in the kidney has not been established.

We identify a complex of the ciliary kinase LKB1 and several ciliopathy-related proteins including NPHP1 and PKD1. At homeostasis, this ciliary module suppresses expression of the chemokine CCL2 in tubular epithelial cells. Deletion of LKB1 or PKD1 in mouse renal tubules elevates CCL2 expression in a cell-autonomous manner and results in peritubular accumulation of CCR2(+) mononuclear phagocytes, promoting a ciliopathy phenotype. Our findings establish an epithelial organelle, the cilium, as a gatekeeper of tissue immune cell numbers.

However, the mechanisms underlying feeding state-dependent behavioral changes remain undefined. Previous studies have shown that Caenorhabditis elegans hermaphrodite exhibits avoidance behaviors to acute exposure of a pheromone, ascr#3 (asc-DeltaC9, C9). Here, we show that the ascr#3 avoidance behavior is modulated by feeding state via the insulin signaling pathway. Starvation increases ascr#3 avoidance behavior, and loss-of-function mutations in daf-2 insulin-like receptor gene dampen this starvation-induced ascr#3 avoidance behavior. DAF-2 and its downstream signaling molecules, including the DAF-16 FOXO transcription factor, act in the ascr#3-sensing ADL neurons to regulate synaptic transmission to downstream target neurons, including the AVA command interneurons. Moreover, we found that starvation decreases the secretion of INS-18 insulin-like peptides from the intestine, which antagonizes DAF-2 function in the ADL neurons. Altogether, this study provides insights about the molecular communication between intestine and sensory neurons delivering hunger message to sensory neurons, which regulates avoidance behavior from pheromones to facilitate survival chance.",Feeding state regulates pheromone-mediated avoidance behavior via the insulin signaling pathway in Caenorhabditis elegans.,The EMBO journal
29925516,"Homologous recombination is triggered by nucleolytic degradation (resection) of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). DSB resection requires the Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 (MRX) complex, which promotes the activity of Exo1 nuclease through a poorly understood mechanism. Here, we describe the Mre11-R10T mutant variant that accelerates DSB resection compared to wild-type Mre11 by potentiating Exo1-mediated processing. This increased Exo1 resection activity leads to a decreased association of the Ku complex to DSBs and an enhanced DSB resection in G1, indicating that Exo1 has a direct function in preventing Ku association with DSBs. Molecular dynamics simulations show that rotation of the Mre11 capping domains is able to induce unwinding of double-strand DNA (dsDNA). The R10T substitution causes altered orientation of the Mre11 capping domain that leads to persistent melting of the dsDNA end. We propose that MRX creates a specific DNA end structure that promotes Exo1 resection activity by facilitating the persistence of this nuclease on the DSB ends, uncovering a novel MRX function in DSB resection.",The MRX complex regulates Exo1 resection activity by altering DNA end structure.,The EMBO journal

In normal karyotypes, we detected stable, recurring arrangements and interactions between the three chromosomal territories with a tissue-specific interaction bias at certain loci. These inter-chromosomal interactions were confirmed by Hi-C. Interestingly, the disease-related HDAC4 deletion resulted in displaced inter-chromosomal arrangements and altered interactions between the deletion-affected chromosome 2 and chromosome 12 and/or 17 in 2q37-deletion syndrome patients.

However, it is debated how small amounts of cargo can mediate this effect, especially in tumors where all cells are from one subtype, and only subtle molecular differences drive metastatic heterogeneity. To study this, we have characterized the content of EVs shed in vivo by two clones of melanoma (B16) tumors with distinct metastatic potential. Using the Cre-LoxP system and intravital microscopy, we show that cells from these distinct clones phenocopy their migratory behavior through EV exchange. By tandem mass spectrometry and RNA sequencing, we show that EVs shed by these clones into the tumor microenvironment contain thousands of different proteins and RNAs, and many of these biomolecules are from interconnected signaling networks involved in cellular processes such as migration.

Contrary to the common view that EMT factors act as transcriptional repressors, here we show that genome-wide binding of Zeb1 associates with both activation and repression of gene expression in glioblastoma stem-like cells. Transcriptional repression requires direct DNA binding of Zeb1, while indirect recruitment to regulatory regions by the Wnt pathway effector Lef1 results in gene activation, independently of Wnt signaling. Amongst glioblastoma genes activated by Zeb1 are predicted mediators of tumor cell migration and invasion, including the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Prex1, whose elevated expression is predictive of shorter glioblastoma patient survival.

So far, the mechanisms of GSDMD(Nterm) insertion, oligomerization, and pore formation are poorly understood. Here, we apply high-resolution (</= 2 nm) atomic force microscopy (AFM) to describe how GSDMD(Nterm) inserts and assembles in membranes. We observe GSDMD(Nterm) inserting into a variety of lipid compositions, among which phosphatidylinositide (PI(4,5)P2) increases and cholesterol reduces insertion. Once inserted, GSDMD(Nterm) assembles arc-, slit-, and ring-shaped oligomers, each of which being able to form transmembrane pores. This assembly and pore formation process is independent on whether GSDMD has been cleaved by caspase-1, caspase-4, or caspase-5. Using time-lapse AFM, we monitor how GSDMD(Nterm) assembles into arc-shaped oligomers that can transform into larger slit-shaped and finally into stable ring-shaped oligomers.

However, it has remained unclear whether such regulation also extends to nuclear RNA decay. Here, we show that 145 unstable nuclear RNAs, including enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) such as NEAT1v2, are stabilized upon Salmonella infection in HeLa cells. In uninfected cells, the RNA exosome, aided by the Nuclear EXosome Targeting (NEXT) complex, degrades these labile transcripts. Upon infection, the levels of the exosome/NEXT components, RRP6 and MTR4, dramatically decrease, resulting in transcript stabilization. Depletion of lncRNAs, NEAT1v2, or eRNA07573 in HeLa cells triggers increased susceptibility to Salmonella infection concomitant with the deregulated expression of a distinct class of immunity-related genes, indicating that the accumulation of unstable nuclear RNAs contributes to antibacterial defense.

We show that astrocytic NF-kappaB activation drives microglial proliferation and leukocyte infiltration in the SOD1 (G93A) ALS model. This response prolongs the presymptomatic phase, delaying muscle denervation and decreasing disease burden, but turns detrimental in the symptomatic phase, accelerating disease progression. The transition corresponds to a shift in the microglial phenotype showing two effects that can be dissociated by temporally controlling NF-kappaB activation. While NF-kappaB activation in astrocytes induced a Wnt-dependent microglial proliferation in the presymptomatic phase with neuroprotective effects on motoneurons, in later stage, astrocyte NF-kappaB-dependent microglial activation caused an accelerated disease progression. Notably, suppression of the early microglial response by CB2R agonists had acute detrimental effects. These data identify astrocytes as important regulators of microglia expansion and immune response.

Cisplatin-resistant clones were more sensitive to killing by nutrient deprivation in vitro and in vivo than their parental cisplatin-sensitive controls. The susceptibility of cisplatin-resistant cells to starvation could be explained by a particularly strong dependence on glutamine. Glutamine depletion was sufficient to restore cisplatin responses of initially cisplatin-resistant clones, and glutamine supplementation rescued cisplatin-resistant clones from starvation-induced death. Mass spectrometric metabolomics and specific interventions on glutamine metabolism revealed that, in cisplatin-resistant cells, glutamine is mostly required for nucleotide biosynthesis rather than for anaplerotic, bioenergetic or redox reactions. As a result, cisplatin-resistant cancers became exquisitely sensitive to treatment with antimetabolites that target nucleoside metabolism.",Metabolic vulnerability of cisplatin-resistant cancers.,The EMBO journal

Using this technique, we found that tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2), as well as TRAF1 and 3, directly binds to the active caspase-2 dimer. TRAF2 in particular is necessary for caspase-2 activation in response to apoptotic cell death stimuli. Furthermore, we found that dimerized caspase-2 is ubiquitylated in a TRAF2-dependent manner at K15, K152, and K153, which in turn stabilizes the active caspase-2 dimer complex, promotes its association with an insoluble cellular fraction, and enhances its activity to fully commit the cell to apoptosis.

During EMT, QKI-5 directly binds to and regulates hundreds of alternative splicing targets and exerts pleiotropic effects, such as increasing cell migration and invasion and restraining tumour growth, without appreciably affecting mRNA levels. QKI-5 is both necessary and sufficient to direct EMT-associated alternative splicing changes, and this splicing signature is broadly conserved across many epithelial-derived cancer types. Importantly, several actin cytoskeleton-associated genes are directly targeted by both QKI and miR-200c, revealing coordinated control of alternative splicing and mRNA abundance during EMT These findings demonstrate the existence of a miR-200/miR-375/QKI axis that impacts cancer-associated epithelial cell plasticity through widespread control of alternative splicing.",miR-200/375 control epithelial plasticity-associated alternative splicing by repressing the RNA-binding protein Quaking.,The EMBO journal

By contrast, little is known about anti-virulence genes, which contribute to the start, progression, and outcome of an infection.

Specifically, we establish that the anti-virulence protein CigR directly restrains the virulence protein MgtC, thereby hindering intramacrophage survival, inhibition of ATP synthesis, stabilization of cytoplasmic pH, and gene transcription by the master virulence regulator PhoP. We determine that, like MgtC, CigR localizes to the bacterial inner membrane and that its C-terminal domain is critical for inhibition of MgtC. As in many toxin/anti-toxin genes implicated in antibiotic tolerance, the mgtC and cigR genes are part of the same mRNA.

We show that ALIX is recruited to the pericentriolar material (PCM) of the centrosomes and promotes correct orientation of the MS in asymmetrically dividing Drosophila stem cells and epithelial cells, and symmetrically dividing Drosophila and human epithelial cells. ALIX-deprived cells display defective formation of astral microtubules (MTs), which results in abnormal MS orientation. Specifically, ALIX is recruited to the PCM via Drosophila Spindle defective 2 (DSpd-2)/Cep192, where ALIX promotes accumulation of gamma-tubulin and thus facilitates efficient nucleation of astral MTs. In addition, ALIX promotes MT stability by recruiting microtubule-associated protein 1S (MAP1S), which stabilizes newly formed MTs.

Here, we investigated the mechanisms through which photodynamic therapy (PDT) with redaporfin kills cancer cells. Subcellular localization and fractionation studies based on the physicochemical properties of redaporfin revealed its selective tropism for the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus (GA). When activated, redaporfin caused rapid reactive oxygen species-dependent perturbation of ER/GA compartments, coupled to ER stress and an inhibition of the GA-dependent secretory pathway. This led to a general inhibition of protein secretion by PDT-treated cancer cells. The ER/GA play a role upstream of mitochondria in the lethal signaling pathway triggered by redaporfin-based PDT Pharmacological perturbation of GA function or homeostasis reduces mitochondrial permeabilization. In contrast, removal of the pro-apoptotic multidomain proteins BAX and BAK or pretreatment with protease inhibitors reduced cell killing, yet left the GA perturbation unaffected.

We searched for REV7-associated factors in human cells and found FAM35A, a previously unstudied protein with an unstructured N-terminal region and a C-terminal region harboring three OB-fold domains similar to single-stranded DNA-binding protein RPA, as novel interactor of REV7/RIF1/53BP1. FAM35A re-localized in damaged cell nuclei, and its knockdown caused sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents. In a BRCA1-mutant cell line, however, depletion of FAM35A increased resistance to camptothecin, suggesting that FAM35A participates in processing of DNA ends to allow more efficient DNA repair. We found FAM35A absent in one widely used BRCA1-mutant cancer cell line (HCC1937) with anomalous resistance to PARP inhibitors.

Due to its highly repetitive nature and transcriptional activity, the nucleolus is considered a hotspot of genomic instability. Breaks in rDNA induce a transient transcriptional shut down to conserve energy and promote rDNA repair; however, how nucleolar chromatin is modified and impacts on rDNA repair is unknown. Here, we uncover that phosphorylation of serine 14 on histone H2B marks transcriptionally inactive nucleolar chromatin in response to DNA damage. We identified that the MST2 kinase localises at the nucleoli and targets phosphorylation of H2BS14p in an ATM-dependent manner. We show that establishment of H2BS14p is necessary for damage-induced rDNA transcriptional shut down and maintenance of genomic integrity. Ablation of MST2 kinase, or upstream activators, results in defective establishment of nucleolar H2BS14p, perturbed DNA damage repair, sensitisation to rDNA damage and increased cell lethality. We highlight the impact of chromatin regulation in the rDNA damage response and targeting of the nucleolus as an emerging cancer therapeutic approach.",MST2 kinase suppresses rDNA transcription in response to DNA damage by phosphorylating nucleolar histone H2B.,The EMBO journal

Storing and providing energy is their main function, but they do not work in isolation. They respond to stimuli initiated either on the cell surface or in the cytoplasm as conditions change. Cellular stresses such as starvation and invasion are internal insults that evoke changes in droplet metabolism and dynamics. This review will first outline lipid droplet assembly and then discuss how droplets respond to stress and in particular nutrient starvation. Finally, the role of droplets in viral and microbial invasion will be presented, where an unresolved issue is whether changes in droplet abundance promote the invader, defend the host, to try to do both. The challenges of stress and infection are often accompanied by changes in physical contacts between droplets and other organelles. How these changes may result in improving cellular physiology, an ongoing focus in the field, is discussed.",The assembly of lipid droplets and their roles in challenged cells.,The EMBO journal

Although there is evidence supporting the idea that LRRK2 has an immune function, the cellular function of this kinase is still largely unknown. By using genetic, pharmacological and proteomics approaches, we show that LRRK2 kinase activity negatively regulates phagosome maturation via the recruitment of the Class III phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase complex and Rubicon to the phagosome in macrophages. Moreover, inhibition of LRRK2 kinase activity in mouse and human macrophages enhanced Mycobacterium tuberculosis phagosome maturation and mycobacterial control independently of autophagy. In vivo, LRRK2 deficiency in mice resulted in a significant decrease in M. tuberculosis burdens early during the infection. Collectively, our findings provide a molecular mechanism explaining genetic evidence linking LRRK2 to mycobacterial diseases and establish an LRRK2-dependent cellular pathway that controls M. tuberculosis replication by regulating phagosome maturation.",LRRK2 is a negative regulator of Mycobacterium tuberculosis phagosome maturation in macrophages.,The EMBO journal

Similar such helicase activity for resolving secondary structures and structure-specific nuclease activity are needed during DNA replication to process the chromosome-specific higher order repeat units present in the centromeres of human chromosomes. Here, we show that DNA2 binds preferentially to centromeric DNA The nuclease and helicase activities of DNA2 are both essential for resolution of DNA structural obstacles to facilitate DNA replication fork movement. Loss of DNA2-mediated clean-up mechanisms impairs centromeric DNA replication and CENP-A deposition, leading to activation of the ATR DNA damage checkpoints at centromeric DNA regions and late-S/G2 cell cycle arrest. Cells that escape arrest show impaired metaphase plate formation and abnormal chromosomal segregation. Furthermore, the DNA2 inhibitor C5 mimics DNA2 knockout and synergistically kills cancer cells when combined with an ATR inhibitor.

29769405,"Dopaminergic neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with abnormal dopamine metabolism by MAO-B (monoamine oxidase-B) and intracellular alpha-Synuclein (alpha-Syn) aggregates, called the Lewy body. However, the molecular relationship between alpha-Syn and MAO-B remains unclear. Here, we show that alpha-Syn directly binds to MAO-B and stimulates its enzymatic activity, which triggers AEP (asparagine endopeptidase; legumain) activation and subsequent alpha-Syn cleavage at N103, leading to dopaminergic neurodegeneration. Interestingly, the dopamine metabolite, DOPAL, strongly activates AEP, and the N103 fragment of alpha-Syn binds and activates MAO-B. Accordingly, overexpression of AEP in SNCA transgenic mice elicits alpha-Syn N103 cleavage and accelerates PD pathogenesis, and inhibition of MAO-B by Rasagiline diminishes alpha-Syn-mediated PD pathology and motor dysfunction. Moreover, virally mediated expression of alpha-Syn N103 induces PD pathogenesis in wild-type, but not MAO-B-null mice. Our findings thus support that AEP-mediated cleavage of alpha-Syn at N103 is required for the association and activation of MAO-B, mediating PD pathogenesis.",alpha-Synuclein stimulation of monoamine oxidase-B and legumain protease mediates the pathology of Parkinson's disease.,The EMBO journal

The recruitment of SUMO E3 ligases to chromatin may represent one layer of control on protein sumoylation. However, we currently do not understand how cells upregulate the activity of E3 ligases on chromatin. Here we show that the Nse2 SUMO E3 in the Smc5/6 complex, a critical player during recombinational DNA repair, is directly stimulated by binding to DNA Activation of sumoylation requires the electrostatic interaction between DNA and a positively charged patch in the ARM domain of Smc5, which acts as a DNA sensor that subsequently promotes a stimulatory activation of the E3 activity in Nse2. Specific disruption of the interaction between the ARM of Smc5 and DNA sensitizes cells to DNA damage, indicating that this mechanism contributes to DNA repair. These results reveal a mechanism to enhance a SUMO E3 ligase activity by direct DNA binding and to restrict sumoylation in the vicinity of those Smc5/6-Nse2 molecules engaged on DNA.",DNA activates the Nse2/Mms21 SUMO E3 ligase in the Smc5/6 complex.,The EMBO journal

Gametocyte-specific factor 1 (Gtsf1) proteins, characterized by two tandem CHHC zinc fingers and an unstructured C-terminal tail, are conserved in animals and have been shown to interact with Piwi clade Argonautes, thereby assisting their activity. We identified the Caenorhabditis elegans Gtsf1 homolog, named it gtsf-1 and characterized it in the context of the sRNA pathways of C. elegans We report that GTSF-1 is not required for Piwi-mediated gene silencing. Instead, gtsf-1 mutants show a striking depletion of 26G-RNAs, a class of endogenous sRNAs, fully phenocopying rrf-3 mutants. We show, both in vivo and in vitro, that GTSF-1 interacts with RRF-3 via its CHHC zinc fingers. Furthermore, we demonstrate that GTSF-1 is required for the assembly of a larger RRF-3 and DCR-1-containing complex (ERIC), thereby allowing for 26G-RNA generation.

29764982,"Proper floral patterning, including the number and position of floral organs in most plant species, is tightly controlled by the precise regulation of the persistence and size of floral meristems (FMs). In Arabidopsis, two known feedback pathways, one composed of WUSCHEL (WUS) and CLAVATA3 (CLV3) and the other composed of AGAMOUS (AG) and WUS, spatially and temporally control floral stem cells, respectively. However, mounting evidence suggests that other factors, including phytohormones, are also involved in floral meristem regulation. Here, we show that the boundary gene SUPERMAN (SUP) bridges floral organogenesis and floral meristem determinacy in another pathway that involves auxin signaling. SUP interacts with components of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) and fine-tunes local auxin signaling by negatively regulating the expression of the auxin biosynthesis genes YUCCA1/4 (YUC1/4). In sup mutants, derepressed local YUC1/4 activity elevates auxin levels at the boundary between whorls 3 and 4, which leads to an increase in the number and the prolonged maintenance of floral stem cells, and consequently an increase in the number of reproductive organs. Our work presents a new floral meristem regulatory mechanism, in which SUP, a boundary gene, coordinates floral organogenesis and floral meristem size through fine-tuning auxin biosynthesis.",SUPERMAN regulates floral whorl boundaries through control of auxin biosynthesis.,The EMBO journal

However, how TARDBP mutations trigger pathogenesis remains unknown. Here, we use novel mouse mutants carrying point mutations in endogenous Tardbp to dissect TDP-43 function at physiological levels both in vitro and in vivo Interestingly, we find that mutations within the C-terminal domain of TDP-43 lead to a gain of splicing function. Using two different strains, we are able to separate TDP-43 loss- and gain-of-function effects. TDP-43 gain-of-function effects in these mice reveal a novel category of splicing events controlled by TDP-43, referred to as ""skiptic"" exons, in which skipping of constitutive exons causes changes in gene expression. In vivo, this gain-of-function mutation in endogenous Tardbp causes an adult-onset neuromuscular phenotype accompanied by motor neuron loss and neurodegenerative changes. Furthermore, we have validated the splicing gain-of-function and skiptic exons in ALS patient-derived cells.

Genetic perturbation of this mechanosensory pathway activates an ectopic fat gene program during cardiomyocyte differentiation, which ultimately primes the cells to switch to the brown/beige adipocyte lineage in response to adipogenesis-inducing signals. We also demonstrate by in vivo fate mapping and clonal analysis of cardiac progenitors that cardiac fat and a subset of cardiac muscle arise from a common precursor expressing Isl1 and Wt1 during heart development, suggesting related mechanisms of determination between the two lineages.",Interplay of cell-cell contacts and RhoA/MRTF-A signaling regulates cardiomyocyte identity.,The EMBO journal

An important mechanism by which these transcription factors are regulated involves their shuttling between the surface of lysosomes, the cytoplasm, and the nucleus. Such dynamic changes in subcellular localization occur in response to nutrient fluctuations and various forms of cell stress and are mediated by changes in the phosphorylation of multiple conserved amino acids. Major kinases responsible for MiT-TFE protein phosphorylation include mTOR, ERK, GSK3, and AKT In addition, calcineurin de-phosphorylates MiT-TFE proteins in response to lysosomal calcium release. Thus, through changes in the phosphorylation state of MiT-TFE proteins, lysosome function is coordinated with the cellular metabolic state and cellular demands.

By analyzing T-cell receptor repertoires and using retrogenic monoclonal T-cell populations, we demonstrate that the virtual memory T-cell formation is a so far unappreciated cell fate decision checkpoint. We describe two molecular mechanisms driving the formation of virtual memory T cells. First, virtual memory T cells originate exclusively from strongly self-reactive T cells. Second, the stoichiometry of the CD8 interaction with Lck regulates the size of the virtual memory T-cell compartment via modulating the self-reactivity of individual T cells. Although virtual memory T cells descend from the highly self-reactive clones and acquire a partial memory program, they are not more potent in inducing experimental autoimmune diabetes than naive T cells.

By combining mutagenesis with biophysical and functional analyses, we show that the modes of CEACAM recognition by HopQ and CEACAMs themselves are starkly different.

Specific miRNAs are required for NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-dependent synaptic plasticity by modulating the translation of proteins involved in dendritic spine morphogenesis or synaptic transmission. However, it is unknown how NMDAR stimulation stimulates RISC activity to rapidly repress translation of synaptic proteins. We show that NMDAR stimulation transiently increases Akt-dependent phosphorylation of Ago2 at S387, which causes an increase in binding to GW182 and a rapid increase in translational repression of LIMK1 via miR-134. Furthermore, NMDAR-dependent down-regulation of endogenous LIMK1 translation in dendrites and dendritic spine shrinkage requires phospho-regulation of Ago2 at S387. AMPAR trafficking and hippocampal LTD do not involve S387 phosphorylation, defining this mechanism as a specific pathway for structural plasticity.

Similarly, many B-cell lymphomas, including Burkitt lymphoma (BL), require continuous BCR signaling for their tumor growth. This growth is driven by immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) and PI3 kinase (PI3K) signaling. Here, we employ CRISPR/Cas9 to delete BCR and B-cell co-receptor genes in the human BL cell line Ramos. We find that Ramos B cells require the expression of the BCR signaling component Igbeta (CD79b), and the co-receptor CD19, for their fitness and competitive growth in culture. Furthermore, we show that in the absence of any other BCR component, Igbeta can be expressed on the B-cell surface, where it is found in close proximity to CD19 and signals in an ITAM-dependent manner. These data suggest that Igbeta and CD19 are part of an alternative B-cell signaling module that use continuous ITAM/PI3K signaling to promote the survival of B lymphoma and normal B cells.",Continuous signaling of CD79b and CD19 is required for the fitness of Burkitt lymphoma B cells.,The EMBO journal

In addition to G1 cell cycle arrest, palbociclib treatment results in cell senescence, a phenotype that is not readily explained by CDK4/6 inhibition. In order to identify a molecular mechanism responsible for palbociclib-induced senescence, we performed thermal proteome profiling of MCF7 breast cancer cells. In addition to affecting known CDK4/6 targets, palbociclib induces a thermal stabilization of the 20S proteasome, despite not directly binding to it. We further show that palbociclib treatment increases proteasome activity independently of the ubiquitin pathway. This leads to cellular senescence, which can be counteracted by proteasome inhibitors. Palbociclib-induced proteasome activation and senescence is mediated by reduced proteasomal association of ECM29. Loss of ECM29 activates the proteasome, blocks cell proliferation, and induces a senescence-like phenotype. Finally, we find that ECM29 mRNA levels are predictive of relapse-free survival in breast cancer patients treated with endocrine therapy.

Inactivation of Hfq strikingly decreases the pool of mature 70S ribosomes. The reduction in ribosome levels depends on residues located in the distal face of Hfq but not on residues found in the proximal and rim surfaces which govern interactions with the sRNAs. Our results indicate that Hfq-mediated regulation of ribosomes is independent of its function as sRNA-regulator. Furthermore, we observed that inactivation of Hfq compromises translation efficiency and fidelity, both features of aberrantly assembled ribosomes.

The specific roles of APPsalpha and APPsbeta fragments, generated by non-amyloidogenic or amyloidogenic APP processing, respectively, remain however unclear. Here, we expressed APPsalpha or APPsbeta in the adult brain of conditional double knockout mice (cDKO) lacking APP and the related APLP2. APPsalpha efficiently rescued deficits in spine density, synaptic plasticity (LTP and PPF), and spatial reference memory of cDKO mice. In contrast, APPsbeta failed to show any detectable effects on synaptic plasticity and spine density. The C-terminal 16 amino acids of APPsalpha (lacking in APPsbeta) proved sufficient to facilitate LTP in a mechanism that depends on functional nicotinic alpha7-nAChRs. Further, APPsalpha showed high-affinity, allosteric potentiation of heterologously expressed alpha7-nAChRs in oocytes. Collectively, we identified alpha7-nAChRs as a crucial physiological receptor specific for APPsalpha and show distinct in vivo roles for APPsalpha versus APPsbeta.

Paupar, a CNS-expressed lncRNA, controls neuroblastoma cell growth by binding and modulating the activity of transcriptional regulatory elements in a genome-wide manner. We show here that the Paupar lncRNA directly binds KAP1, an essential epigenetic regulatory protein, and thereby regulates the expression of shared target genes important for proliferation and neuronal differentiation. Paupar promotes KAP1 chromatin occupancy and H3K9me3 deposition at a subset of distal targets, through the formation of a ribonucleoprotein complex containing Paupar, KAP1 and the PAX6 transcription factor. Paupar-KAP1 genome-wide co-occupancy reveals a fourfold enrichment of overlap between Paupar and KAP1 bound sequences, the majority of which also appear to associate with PAX6. Furthermore, both Paupar and Kap1 loss-of-function in vivo disrupt olfactory bulb neurogenesis.

Here, we use budding yeast to analyze phosphorylation dynamics of 3,456 phosphosites on 1,101 proteins with high temporal resolution as cells progress synchronously through mitosis. This reveals that successive inactivation of S and M phase Cdks and of the mitotic kinase Polo contributes to order these dephosphorylation events. Unexpectedly, we detect as many new phosphorylation events as there are dephosphorylation events. These correlate with late mitotic kinase activation and identify numerous candidate targets of these kinases.

Regulation of deoxynucleotide metabolism is required for YAP-induced cell growth and underlies the resistance of YAP-addicted cells to chemotherapeutics targeting dNTP synthesis. During RAS-induced senescence, YAP/TAZ bypass RAS-mediated inhibition of nucleotide metabolism and control senescence. Endogenous YAP/TAZ targets and signatures are inhibited by RAS/MEK1 during senescence, and depletion of YAP/TAZ is sufficient to cause senescence-associated phenotypes, suggesting a role for YAP/TAZ in suppression of senescence. Finally, mechanical cues, such as ECM stiffness and cell geometry, regulate senescence in a YAP-dependent manner. This study indicates that YAP/TAZ couples cell proliferation with a metabolism suited for DNA replication and facilitates escape from oncogene-induced senescence.

The effect of transcriptional interference depends on the strength of transcription from the upstream promoter and can be described quantitatively by a simple reciprocal repressor function. Transcriptional interference coincides with recruitment at the standard downstream promoter of the FACT histone chaperone complex, which is involved in nucleosomal remodelling during transcription.

Chronic sodium salicylate treatment ameliorated muscle alterations and reduced the muscle expression of Fgf21. Muscle inflammation was an early event during the progression of the disease and occurred before macrophage infiltration, indicating that it is a primary response to Opa1 deficiency. Moreover, Opa1 repression in muscle cells also resulted in NF-kappaB activation and inflammation in the absence of necrosis and/or apoptosis, thereby revealing that the activation is a cell-autonomous process and independent of cell death. The effects of Opa1 deficiency on the expression NF-kappaB target genes and inflammation were absent upon mitochondrial DNA depletion.

Enhanced phosphatidylcholine-flippase activity at the PM due to expression of ATP10A, a member of the P4-ATPase family, promoted membrane tubulation upon recruitment of BAR domains to the PM This is the important evidence that changes in the transbilayer lipid composition induced by P4-ATPases can deform biological membranes.",Phospholipid-flipping activity of P4-ATPase drives membrane curvature.,The EMBO journal

29581097,"Polymerase-blocking DNA lesions are thought to elicit a checkpoint response via accumulation of single-stranded DNA at stalled replication forks. However, as an alternative to persistent fork stalling, re-priming downstream of lesions can give rise to daughter-strand gaps behind replication forks. We show here that the processing of such structures by an exonuclease, Exo1, is required for timely checkpoint activation, which in turn prevents further gap erosion in S phase. This Rad9-dependent mechanism of damage signaling is distinct from the Mrc1-dependent, fork-associated response to replication stress induced by conditions such as nucleotide depletion or replisome-inherent problems, but reminiscent of replication-independent checkpoint activation by single-stranded DNA Our results indicate that while replisome stalling triggers a checkpoint response directly at the stalled replication fork, the response to replication stress elicited by polymerase-blocking lesions mainly emanates from Exo1-processed, postreplicative daughter-strand gaps, thus offering a mechanistic explanation for the dichotomy between replisome- versus template-induced checkpoint signaling.",Spatial separation between replisome- and template-induced replication stress signaling.,The EMBO journal
29581096,"Adult mouse muscle satellite cells (MuSCs) are quiescent in uninjured muscles. Upon injury, MuSCs exit quiescence in vivo to become activated, re-enter the cell cycle to proliferate, and differentiate to repair the damaged muscles. It remains unclear which extrinsic cues and intrinsic signaling pathways regulate quiescence exit during MuSC activation. Here, we demonstrated that inducible MuSC-specific deletion of p110alpha, a catalytic subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), rendered MuSCs unable to exit quiescence, resulting in severely impaired MuSC proliferation and muscle regeneration. Genetic reactivation of mTORC1, or knockdown of FoxOs, in p110alpha-null MuSCs partially rescued the above defects, making them key effectors downstream of PI3K in regulating quiescence exit. c-Jun was found to be a key transcriptional target of the PI3K/mTORC1 signaling axis essential for MuSC quiescence exit. Moreover, induction of a constitutively active PI3K in quiescent MuSCs resulted in spontaneous MuSC activation in uninjured muscles and subsequent depletion of the MuSC pool. Thus, PI3K-p110alpha is both necessary and sufficient for MuSCs to exit quiescence in response to activating signals.",p110alpha of PI3K is necessary and sufficient for quiescence exit in adult muscle satellite cells.,The EMBO journal

However, the molecular mechanisms controlling ciliary membrane establishment and maintenance, especially in relation to endocytosis, remain poorly understood. Here, using Caenorhabditis elegans, we describe closely linked functions for early endosome (EE) maturation factors RABS-5 (Rabenosyn-5) and VPS-45 (VPS45) in regulating cilium length and morphology, ciliary and periciliary membrane volume, and ciliary signalling-related sensory behaviour. We demonstrate that RABS-5 and VPS-45 control periciliary vesicle number and levels of select EE/endocytic markers (WDFY-2, CAV-1) and the ciliopathy membrane receptor PKD-2 (polycystin-2). Moreover, we show that CAV-1 (caveolin-1) also controls PKD-2 ciliary levels and associated sensory behaviour. These data link RABS-5 and VPS-45 ciliary functions to the processing of periciliary-derived endocytic vesicles and regulation of ciliary membrane homeostasis.

One example is non-growing cells in clonal bacterial populations that are able to persist antibiotic treatment. Previous studies suggest that persisters arise in bacterial populations either stochastically through variation in levels of global signalling molecules between individual cells, or in response to various stresses. Here, we show that toxins used in contact-dependent growth inhibition (CDI) create persisters upon direct contact with cells lacking sufficient levels of CdiI immunity protein, which would otherwise bind to and neutralize toxin activity. CDI-mediated persisters form through a feedforward cycle where the toxic activity of the CdiA toxin increases cellular (p)ppGpp levels, which results in Lon-mediated degradation of the immunity protein and more free toxin. Thus, CDI systems mediate a population density-dependent bet-hedging strategy, where the fraction of non-growing cells is increased only when there are many cells of the same genotype. This may be one of the mechanisms of how CDI systems increase the fitness of their hosts.",Contact-dependent growth inhibition induces high levels of antibiotic-tolerant persister cells in clonal bacterial populations.,The EMBO journal

However, the mechanism underlying the regulation of actin organization during recycling transport remains elusive. Here we report that the loss of PTRN-1/CAMSAP stalled actin exchange and diminished the cytosolic actin structures. Furthermore, we found that PTRN-1 is required for the recycling of clathrin-independent cargo hTAC-GFP The N-terminal calponin homology (CH) domain and central coiled-coils (CC) region of PTRN-1 can synergistically sustain the flow of hTAC-GFP We identified CYK-1/formin as a binding partner of PTRN-1. The N-terminal GTPase-binding domain (GBD) of CYK-1 serves as the binding interface for the PTRN-1 CH domain. The presence of the PTRN-1 CH domain promoted CYK-1-mediated actin polymerization, which suggests that the PTRN-1-CH:CYK-1-GBD interaction efficiently relieves autoinhibitory interactions within CYK-1. As expected, the overexpression of the CYK-1 formin homology domain 2 (FH2) substantially restored actin structures and partially suppressed the hTAC-GFP overaccumulation phenotype in ptrn-1 mutants. We conclude that the PTRN-1 CH domain is required to stimulate CYK-1 to facilitate actin dynamics during endocytic recycling.",PTRN-1/CAMSAP promotes CYK-1/formin-dependent actin polymerization during endocytic recycling.,The EMBO journal

Here, we studied the impact of structural centrosome aberrations, induced by deregulated expression of ninein-like protein (NLP), on epithelial spheres grown in Matrigel matrices. We demonstrate that NLP-induced structural centrosome aberrations trigger the escape (""budding"") of living cells from epithelia. Remarkably, all cells disseminating into the matrix were undergoing mitosis. This invasive behavior reflects a novel mechanism that depends on the acquisition of two distinct properties. First, NLP-induced centrosome aberrations trigger a re-organization of the cytoskeleton, which stabilizes microtubules and weakens E-cadherin junctions during mitosis. Second, atomic force microscopy reveals that cells harboring these centrosome aberrations display increased stiffness. As a consequence, mitotic cells are pushed out of mosaic epithelia, particularly if they lack centrosome aberrations. We conclude that centrosome aberrations can trigger cell dissemination through a novel, non-cell-autonomous mechanism, raising the prospect that centrosome aberrations contribute to the dissemination of metastatic cells harboring normal centrosomes.",Structural centrosome aberrations promote non-cell-autonomous invasiveness.,The EMBO journal

A potent antimalarial peptidomimetic inhibitor (49c) originally developed against Plasmepsin II selectively targets TgASP3, PfPMIX, and PfPMX To unravel the molecular basis for the selectivity of 49c, we constructed homology models of PfPMIX, PfPMX, and TgASP3 that were first validated by identifying the determinants of microneme and rhoptry substrate recognition. The flap and flap-like structures of several reported Plasmepsins are highly flexible and critically modulate the access to the binding cavity. Molecular docking of 49c to TgASP3, PfPMIX, and PfPMX models predicted that the conserved phenylalanine residues in the flap, F344, F291, and F305, respectively, account for the sensitivity toward 49c. Concordantly, phenylalanine mutations in the flap of the three proteases increase twofold to 15-fold the IC50 values of 49c.

Using PdeC, one of the five CSS domain PDEs of Escherichia coli K-12, we show that DsbA/DsbB-promoted disulfide bond formation in the CSS domain reduces PDE activity. By contrast, the free thiol form is enzymatically highly active, with the TM2 region promoting dimerization. Moreover, this form is processed by periplasmic proteases DegP and DegQ, yielding a highly active TM2 + EAL fragment that is slowly removed by further proteolysis.

However, its impact on global elongation and Pol II processivity in mammalian cells has not been clarified. Here, we show that depleting Spt5 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) does not cause global elongation defects or decreased elongation rates. Instead, in Spt5-depleted cells, a fraction of Pol II molecules are dislodged during elongation, thus decreasing the number of Pol II complexes that complete the transcription cycle. Most strikingly, this decrease is restricted to a narrow window between 15 and 20 kb from the promoter, a distance which coincides with the stage where accelerating Pol II attains maximum elongation speed. Consequently, long genes show a greater dependency on Spt5 for optimal elongation efficiency and overall gene expression than short genes. We propose that an important role of Spt5 in mammalian elongation is to promote the processivity of those Pol II complexes that are transitioning toward maximum elongation speed 15-20 kb from the promoter.",Regulation of RNA polymerase II processivity by Spt5 is restricted to a narrow window during elongation.,The EMBO journal

A hydrophobic docking motif binds to a previously uncharacterized pocket on Aurora-A that is blocked in most kinases. Abrogation of the docking motif causes a delay in late mitosis, consistent with the cellular distribution of Aurora-A complexes. Phosphorylation of Ser558 engages a conformational switch in a second motif from a disordered state, needed to bind the kinase active site, into a helical conformation. The helix extends into a third, adjacent motif that is recognized by a helical-repeat region of CHC, not a recognized phospho-reader domain.

OST1 phosphorylates BTF3 and BTF3L in vitro and in vivo, and facilitates their interaction with C-repeat-binding factors (CBFs) to promote CBF stability under cold stress. The phosphorylation of BTF3L at the Ser50 residue by OST1 is required for its function in regulating freezing tolerance.

We show that ATP-bound hRAD51 filaments can exist in two different states with different contour lengths and with a free-energy difference of ~4 kBT per hRAD51 monomer. Upon ATP hydrolysis, the filaments convert into a disassembly-competent ADP-bound configuration. In agreement with the single-molecule analysis, we demonstrate the presence of two distinct protomer interfaces in the crystal structure of a hRAD51-ATP filament, providing a structural basis for the two conformational states of the filament.

Degradation of STING was impaired in p62-deficient cells, which responded with elevated IFN production to foreign DNA and DNA pathogens. In the absence of p62, STING failed to traffic to autophagy-associated vesicles.

Blocking mTORC1 permitted autophagy and metaplastic gene induction but blocked cell cycle re-entry at S-phase. In kidney and liver regeneration and in human gastric metaplasia, mTORC1 also correlated with proliferation. In lysosome-defective Gnptab(-/-) mice, both metaplasia-associated gene expression changes and mTORC1-mediated proliferation were deficient in pancreas and stomach.

While much is known about its metabolism, its transport, and its role in atherosclerotic vascular disease, less is known about its role in neuronal pathophysiology.

Pharmacological depletion of cellular cholesterol entails sensitization of nociceptive neurons and promotes mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia through the activation of voltage-gated Nav1.9 channels. Inflammatory mediators enhance the production of reactive oxygen species and induce partitioning of Nav1.9 channels from cholesterol-rich lipid rafts to cholesterol-poor non-raft regions of the membrane. Low-cholesterol environment enhances voltage-dependent activation of Nav1.9 channels leading to enhanced neuronal excitability, whereas cholesterol replenishment reversed these effects. Consistently, we show that transcutaneous delivery of cholesterol alleviates hypersensitivity in animal models of acute and chronic inflammatory pain.

Furthermore, TCGA database analysis of early-stage human melanoma samples revealed an inverse correlation between C-MYC and patient survival, suggesting that C-MYC expression levels could serve as a prognostic marker for early-stage disease.",AMPK promotes survival of c-Myc-positive melanoma cells by suppressing oxidative stress.,The EMBO journal
29440227,"In neuronal development, dynamic rearrangement of actin promotes axonal growth cone extension, and spatiotemporal translation of local mRNAs in response to guidance cues directs axonal growth cone steering, where cofilin plays a critical role. While regulation of cofilin activity is well studied, regulatory mechanism for cofilin mRNA translation in neurons is unknown. In eukaryotic cells, proteins can be synthesized by cap-dependent or cap-independent mechanism via internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-mediated translation. IRES-mediated translation has been reported in various pathophysiological conditions, but its role in normal physiological environment is poorly understood. Here, we report that 5'UTR of cofilin mRNA contains an IRES element, and cofilin is predominantly translated by IRES-mediated mechanism in neurons. Furthermore, we show that IRES-mediated translation of cofilin is required for both axon extension and axonal growth cone steering. Our results provide new insights into the function of IRES-mediated translation in neuronal development.",IRES-mediated translation of cofilin regulates axonal growth cone extension and turning.,The EMBO journal
29440226,"Human telomerase synthesizes telomeric DNA repeats (GGTTAG)n onto chromosome ends using a short template from its integral telomerase RNA (hTR). However, telomerase is markedly slow for processive DNA synthesis among DNA polymerases. We report here that the unique template-embedded pause signal restricts the first nucleotide incorporation for each repeat synthesized, imparting a significantly greater KM This slow nucleotide incorporation step drastically limits repeat addition processivity and rate under physiological conditions, which is alleviated with augmented concentrations of dGTP or dGDP, and not with dGMP nor other nucleotides. The activity stimulation by dGDP is due to nucleoside diphosphates functioning as substrates for telomerase. Converting the first nucleotide of the repeat synthesized from dG to dA through the telomerase template mutation, hTR-51U, correspondingly shifts telomerase repeat addition activity stimulation to dATP-dependent. In accordance, telomerase without the pause signal synthesizes DNA repeats with extremely high efficiency under low dGTP concentrations and lacks dGTP stimulation. Thus, the first nucleotide incorporation step of the telomerase catalytic cycle is a potential target for therapeutic enhancement of telomerase activity.",A single nucleotide incorporation step limits human telomerase repeat addition activity.,The EMBO journal

Although best known for its predominantly disordered C-terminal domain which mediates ALS inclusions, TDP-43 has a globular N-terminal domain (NTD). Here, we show that TDP-43 NTD assembles into head-to-tail linear chains and that phosphomimetic substitution at S48 disrupts TDP-43 polymeric assembly, discourages liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in vitro, fluidizes liquid-liquid phase separated nuclear TDP-43 reporter constructs in cells, and disrupts RNA splicing activity. Finally, we present the solution NMR structure of a head-to-tail NTD dimer comprised of two engineered variants that allow saturation of the native polymerization interface while disrupting higher-order polymerization. These data provide structural detail for the established mechanistic role of the well-folded TDP-43 NTD in splicing and link this function to LLPS. In addition, the fusion-tag solubilized, recombinant form of TDP-43 full-length protein developed here will enable future phase separation and in vitro biochemical assays on TDP-43 function and interactions that have been hampered in the past by TDP-43 aggregation.","A single N-terminal phosphomimic disrupts TDP-43 polymerization, phase separation, and RNA splicing.",The EMBO journal

Within the Wnt signaling cascade, regulated degradation of beta-catenin by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) affects the outcome of canonical Wnt signaling. Here, we found that abundance of the Wnt cargo receptor Evi (Wls/GPR177), which is required for Wnt protein secretion, is also regulated by the UPS through endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD). In the absence of Wnt ligands, Evi is ubiquitinated and targeted for ERAD in a VCP-dependent manner. Ubiquitination of Evi involves the E2-conjugating enzyme UBE2J2 and the E3-ligase CGRRF1. Furthermore, we show that a triaging complex of Porcn and VCP determines whether Evi enters the secretory or the ERAD pathway. In this way, ERAD-dependent control of Evi availability impacts the scale of Wnt protein secretion by adjusting the amount of Evi to meet the requirement of Wnt protein export. As Wnt and Evi protein levels are often dysregulated in cancer, targeting regulatory ERAD components might be a useful approach for therapeutic interventions.",ERAD-dependent control of the Wnt secretory factor Evi.,The EMBO journal

Natural killer T (NKT) cells, which recognize CD1d-restricted microbial lipids and self-lipids, contribute to the regulation of mucosal immunity, yet the mechanisms underlying their functions remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that NKT cells respond to intestinal lipids and CD11c(+) cells (including dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages) are essential to mediate lipid presentation within the gut ultimately controlling intestinal NKT cell homeostasis and activation. Conversely, CD1d and NKT cells participate in the control of the intestinal bacteria composition and compartmentalization, in the regulation of the IgA repertoire and in the induction of regulatory T cells within the gut. These changes in intestinal homeostasis require CD1d expression on DC/macrophage populations as mice with conditional deletion of CD1d on CD11c(+) cells exhibit dysbiosis and altered immune homeostasis. These results unveil the importance of CD11c(+) cells in controlling lipid-dependent immunity in the intestinal compartment and reveal an NKT cell-DC crosstalk as a key mechanism for the regulation of gut homeostasis.",CD1d-mediated lipid presentation by CD11c(+) cells regulates intestinal homeostasis.,The EMBO journal
29363506,"The atypical E2Fs, E2F7 and E2F8, act as potent transcriptional repressors of DNA replication genes providing them with the ability to induce a permanent S-phase arrest and suppress tumorigenesis. Surprisingly in human cancer, transcript levels of atypical E2Fs are frequently elevated in proliferating cancer cells, suggesting that the tumor suppressor functions of atypical E2Fs might be inhibited through unknown post-translational mechanisms. Here, we show that atypical E2Fs can be directly phosphorylated by checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) to prevent a permanent cell cycle arrest. We found that 14-3-3 protein isoforms interact with both E2Fs in a Chk1-dependent manner. Strikingly, Chk1 phosphorylation and 14-3-3-binding did not relocate or degrade atypical E2Fs, but instead, 14-3-3 is recruited to E2F7/8 target gene promoters to possibly interfere with transcription. We observed that high levels of 14-3-3 strongly correlate with upregulated transcription of atypical E2F target genes in human cancer. Thus, we reveal that Chk1 and 14-3-3 proteins cooperate to inactivate the transcriptional repressor functions of atypical E2Fs. This mechanism might be of particular importance to cancer cells, since they are exposed frequently to DNA-damaging therapeutic reagents.",Chk1 and 14-3-3 proteins inhibit atypical E2Fs to prevent a permanent cell cycle arrest.,The EMBO journal

We have previously shown that transcription termination occurs when elongating RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) collides with the DNA-bound general transcription factor Reb1. We demonstrate here that many different DNA-binding proteins can induce termination by a similar roadblock (RB) mechanism. We generated high-resolution transcription maps by the direct detection of RNAPII upon nuclear depletion of two essential RB factors or when the canonical termination pathways for coding and non-coding RNAs are defective. We show that RB termination occurs genomewide and functions independently of (and redundantly with) the main transcription termination pathways. We provide evidence that transcriptional readthrough at canonical terminators is a significant source of pervasive transcription, which is controlled to a large extent by RB termination. Finally, we demonstrate the occurrence of RB termination around centromeres and tRNA genes, which we suggest shields these regions from RNAPII to preserve their functional integrity.",High-resolution transcription maps reveal the widespread impact of roadblock termination in yeast.,The EMBO journal
29351913,"In vertebrates, the presence of viral RNA in the cytosol is sensed by members of the RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) family, which signal to induce production of type I interferons (IFN). These key antiviral cytokines act in a paracrine and autocrine manner to induce hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), whose protein products restrict viral entry, replication and budding. ISGs include the RLRs themselves: RIG-I, MDA5 and, the least-studied family member, LGP2. In contrast, the IFN system is absent in plants and invertebrates, which defend themselves from viral intruders using RNA interference (RNAi). In RNAi, the endoribonuclease Dicer cleaves virus-derived double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) into small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that target complementary viral RNA for cleavage. Interestingly, the RNAi machinery is conserved in mammals, and we have recently demonstrated that it is able to participate in mammalian antiviral defence in conditions in which the IFN system is suppressed. In contrast, when the IFN system is active, one or more ISGs act to mask or suppress antiviral RNAi. Here, we demonstrate that LGP2 constitutes one of the ISGs that can inhibit antiviral RNAi in mammals. We show that LGP2 associates with Dicer and inhibits cleavage of dsRNA into siRNAs both in vitro and in cells. Further, we show that in differentiated cells lacking components of the IFN response, ectopic expression of LGP2 interferes with RNAi-dependent suppression of gene expression. Conversely, genetic loss of LGP2 uncovers dsRNA-mediated RNAi albeit less strongly than complete loss of the IFN system. Thus, the inefficiency of RNAi as a mechanism of antiviral defence in mammalian somatic cells can be in part attributed to Dicer inhibition by LGP2 induced by type I IFNs. LGP2-mediated antagonism of dsRNA-mediated RNAi may help ensure that viral dsRNA substrates are preserved in order to serve as targets of antiviral ISG proteins.",The RIG-I-like receptor LGP2 inhibits Dicer-dependent processing of long double-stranded RNA and blocks RNA interference in mammalian cells.,The EMBO journal

Here, we report a mechanism by which the termination of neuronal migration is maintained in the postnatal olfactory bulb (OB). During neuronal deceleration in the OB, newborn neurons transiently extend a protrusion from the proximal part of their leading process in the resting phase, which we refer to as a filopodium-like lateral protrusion (FLP). The FLP formation is induced by PlexinD1 downregulation and local Rac1 activation, which coincide with microtubule reorganization and the pausing of somal translocation. The somal translocation of resting neurons is suppressed by microtubule polymerization within the FLP The timing of neuronal migration termination, controlled by Sema3E-PlexinD1-Rac1 signaling, influences the final positioning, dendritic patterns, and functions of the neurons in the OB These results suggest that PlexinD1 signaling controls FLP formation and the termination of neuronal migration through a precise control of microtubule dynamics.",PlexinD1 signaling controls morphological changes and migration termination in newborn neurons.,The EMBO journal

However, the nature of the protein substrates targeted for autophagy is unclear. Here, we developed a reconstituted system using purified components and show that p62 and ubiquitinated proteins spontaneously coalesce into larger clusters. Efficient cluster formation requires substrates modified with at least two ubiquitin chains longer than three moieties and is based on p62 filaments cross-linked by the substrates. The reaction is inhibited by free ubiquitin, K48-, and K63-linked ubiquitin chains, as well as by the autophagosomal marker LC3B, suggesting a tight cross talk with general proteostasis and autophagosome formation.

Here, we compared the conformation and dynamics of precursor, latent, and Tolloid-cleaved GDF8 pro-complexes to understand structural mechanisms underlying latency and activation of GDF8. Negative stain electron microscopy (EM) of precursor and latent pro-complexes reveals a V-shaped conformation that is unaltered by furin cleavage and sharply contrasts with the ring-like, cross-armed conformation of latent TGF-beta1. Surprisingly, Tolloid-cleaved GDF8 does not immediately dissociate, but in EM exhibits structural heterogeneity consistent with partial dissociation. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange was not affected by furin cleavage. In contrast, Tolloid cleavage, in the absence of prodomain-growth factor dissociation, increased exchange in regions that correspond in pro-TGF-beta1 to the alpha1-helix, latency lasso, and beta1-strand in the prodomain and to the beta6'- and beta7'-strands in the growth factor. Thus, these regions are important in maintaining GDF8 latency.

Crystal structures and SAXS analyses show that pro-myostatin adopts an open, V-shaped structure with a domain-swapped arrangement. The pro-mature complex, after cleavage of the furin site, has significantly reduced activity compared with the mature growth factor and persists as a stable complex that is resistant to the natural antagonist follistatin. The latency appears to be conferred by a number of distinct features that collectively stabilise the interaction of the pro-domains with the mature growth factor, enabling a regulated stepwise activation process, distinct from the prototypical pro-TGF-beta1.

Factors controlling the targeting of ATG16L1 to phagophores are dispensable for non-canonical autophagy, for which the mechanism of ATG16L1 recruitment is unknown. Here we show that the WD repeat-containing C-terminal domain (WD40 CTD) of ATG16L1 is essential for LC3 recruitment to endolysosomal membranes during non-canonical autophagy, but dispensable for canonical autophagy. Using this strategy to inhibit non-canonical autophagy specifically, we show a reduction of MHC class II antigen presentation in dendritic cells from mice lacking the WD40 CTD Further, we demonstrate activation of non-canonical autophagy dependent on the WD40 CTD during influenza A virus infection.

Unexpectedly, the TRAK1 and TRAK2 motor protein adaptors can still localise to the outer mitochondrial membrane to drive anterograde mitochondrial motility in Miro1/2 double-knockout cells. In contrast, we show that TRAK2-mediated retrograde mitochondrial transport is Miro1-dependent. Interestingly, we find that Miro is critical for recruiting and stabilising the mitochondrial myosin Myo19 on the mitochondria for coupling mitochondria to the actin cytoskeleton. Moreover, Miro depletion during PINK1/Parkin-dependent mitophagy can also drive a loss of mitochondrial Myo19 upon mitochondrial damage. Finally, aberrant positioning of mitochondria in Miro1/2 double-knockout cells leads to disruption of correct mitochondrial segregation during mitosis.

We demonstrate that PARL-mediated cleavage during mitochondrial import partitions STARD7 to the cytosol and the mitochondrial intermembrane space. Negatively charged amino acids in STARD7 serve as a sorting signal allowing mitochondrial release of mature STARD7 upon cleavage by PARL On the other hand, membrane insertion of STARD7 mediated by the TIM23 complex promotes mitochondrial localization of mature STARD7.

ER-beta is retained within the ER in a soluble, polymeric state, despite reaching very high concentrations exceeding those of ER-resident molecular chaperones. ER-beta is not removed by ER-associated degradation (ERAD) but interferes with ERAD of other proteins.

E-Syt1 tethers and transports lipids in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner, but the role of Ca(2+) in this regulation is unclear. Of the five C2 domains of E-Syt1, only C2A and C2C contain Ca(2+)-binding sites. Using liposome-based assays, we show that Ca(2+) binding to C2C promotes E-Syt1-mediated membrane tethering by releasing an inhibition that prevents C2E from interacting with PI(4,5)P2-rich membranes, as previously suggested by studies in semi-permeabilized cells. Importantly, Ca(2+) binding to C2A enables lipid transport by releasing a charge-based autoinhibitory interaction between this domain and the SMP domain. Supporting these results, E-Syt1 constructs defective in Ca(2+) binding in either C2A or C2C failed to rescue two defects in PM lipid homeostasis observed in E-Syts KO cells, delayed diacylglycerol clearance from the PM and impaired Ca(2+)-triggered phosphatidylserine scrambling. Thus, a main effect of Ca(2+) on E-Syt1 is to reverse an autoinhibited state and to couple membrane tethering with lipid transport.",Ca(2+) releases E-Syt1 autoinhibition to couple ER-plasma membrane tethering with lipid transport.,The EMBO journal
29217591,"Mammalian genomes are spatially organized into compartments, topologically associating domains (TADs), and loops to facilitate gene regulation and other chromosomal functions. How compartments, TADs, and loops are generated is unknown. It has been proposed that cohesin forms TADs and loops by extruding chromatin loops until it encounters CTCF, but direct evidence for this hypothesis is missing. Here, we show that cohesin suppresses compartments but is required for TADs and loops, that CTCF defines their boundaries, and that the cohesin unloading factor WAPL and its PDS5 binding partners control the length of loops. In the absence of WAPL and PDS5 proteins, cohesin forms extended loops, presumably by passing CTCF sites, accumulates in axial chromosomal positions (vermicelli), and condenses chromosomes. Unexpectedly, PDS5 proteins are also required for boundary function. These results show that cohesin has an essential genome-wide function in mediating long-range chromatin interactions and support the hypothesis that cohesin creates these by loop extrusion, until it is delayed by CTCF in a manner dependent on PDS5 proteins, or until it is released from DNA by WAPL.","Topologically associating domains and chromatin loops depend on cohesin and are regulated by CTCF, WAPL, and PDS5 proteins.",The EMBO journal
29217590,"Fertilization triggers assembly of higher-order chromatin structure from a condensed maternal and a naive paternal genome to generate a totipotent embryo. Chromatin loops and domains have been detected in mouse zygotes by single-nucleus Hi-C (snHi-C), but not bulk Hi-C. It is therefore unclear when and how embryonic chromatin conformations are assembled. Here, we investigated whether a mechanism of cohesin-dependent loop extrusion generates higher-order chromatin structures within the one-cell embryo. Using snHi-C of mouse knockout embryos, we demonstrate that the zygotic genome folds into loops and domains that critically depend on Scc1-cohesin and that are regulated in size and linear density by Wapl. Remarkably, we discovered distinct effects on maternal and paternal chromatin loop sizes, likely reflecting differences in loop extrusion dynamics and epigenetic reprogramming. Dynamic polymer models of chromosomes reproduce changes in snHi-C, suggesting a mechanism where cohesin locally compacts chromatin by active loop extrusion, whose processivity is controlled by Wapl. Our simulations and experimental data provide evidence that cohesin-dependent loop extrusion organizes mammalian genomes over multiple scales from the one-cell embryo onward.",A mechanism of cohesin-dependent loop extrusion organizes zygotic genome architecture.,The EMBO journal

Molecular chaperones have been implicated in suppressing or delaying the aggregation of mutant Htt. Using in vitro and in vivo assays, we have identified a trimeric chaperone complex (Hsc70, Hsp110, and J-protein) that completely suppresses fibrilization of HttExon1Q48 The composition of this chaperone complex is variable as recruitment of different chaperone family members forms distinct functional complexes. The trimeric chaperone complex is also able to resolubilize Htt fibrils. We confirmed the biological significance of these findings in HD patient-derived neural cells and on an organismal level in Caenorhabditis elegans Among the proteins in this chaperone complex, the J-protein is the concentration-limiting factor. The single overexpression of DNAJB1 in HEK293T cells is sufficient to profoundly reduce HttExon1Q97 aggregation and represents a target of future therapeutic avenues for HD.",Complete suppression of Htt fibrilization and disaggregation of Htt fibrils by a trimeric chaperone complex.,The EMBO journal
29212815,"Parkinson's disease predisposing LRRK2 kinase phosphorylates a group of Rab GTPase proteins including Rab29, within the effector-binding switch II motif. Previous work indicated that Rab29, located within the PARK16 locus mutated in Parkinson's patients, operates in a common pathway with LRRK2. Here, we show that Rab29 recruits LRRK2 to the trans-Golgi network and greatly stimulates its kinase activity. Pathogenic LRRK2 R1441G/C and Y1699C mutants that promote GTP binding are more readily recruited to the Golgi and activated by Rab29 than wild-type LRRK2. We identify conserved residues within the LRRK2 ankyrin domain that are required for Rab29-mediated Golgi recruitment and kinase activation. Consistent with these findings, knockout of Rab29 in A549 cells reduces endogenous LRRK2-mediated phosphorylation of Rab10. We show that mutations that prevent LRRK2 from interacting with either Rab29 or GTP strikingly inhibit phosphorylation of a cluster of highly studied biomarker phosphorylation sites (Ser910, Ser935, Ser955 and Ser973). Our data reveal that Rab29 is a master regulator of LRRK2, controlling its activation, localization, and potentially biomarker phosphorylation.",Rab29 activation of the Parkinson's disease-associated LRRK2 kinase.,The EMBO journal

The centromere is distinguished by the presence of nucleosomes containing the histone H3 variant, CENP-A. In budding yeast, centromere establishment begins with the recognition of a specific DNA sequence by the CBF3 complex. This in turn facilitates CENP-A(Cse4) nucleosome deposition and kinetochore assembly. Here, we describe a 3.6 A single-particle cryo-EM reconstruction of the core CBF3 complex, incorporating the sequence-specific DNA-binding protein Cep3 together with regulatory subunits Ctf13 and Skp1. This provides the first structural data on Ctf13, defining it as an F-box protein of the leucine-rich-repeat family, and demonstrates how a novel F-box-mediated interaction between Ctf13 and Skp1 is responsible for initial assembly of the CBF3 complex.",Structural basis for assembly of the CBF3 kinetochore complex.,The EMBO journal

Modeling the consequences of aneuploidy has relied on perturbing spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) components, but interpretations of these experiments are clouded by the multiple functions of these proteins. Here, we used a Cre recombinase-mediated chromosome loss strategy to individually delete mouse chromosomes 9, 10, 12, or 14 in tetraploid immortalized murine embryonic fibroblasts. This methodology also involves the generation of a dicentric chromosome intermediate, which subsequently undergoes a series of breakage-fusion-bridge (BFB) cycles. While the aneuploid cells generally display a growth disadvantage in vitro, they grow significantly better in low adherence sphere-forming conditions and three of the four lines are transformed in vivo, forming large and invasive tumors in immunocompromised mice. The aneuploid cells display increased chromosomal instability and DNA damage, a mutator phenotype associated with tumorigenesis in vivo Thus, these studies demonstrate a causative role for whole chromosome loss and the associated BFB-mediated instability in tumorigenesis and may shed light on the early consequences of aneuploidy in mammalian cells.",Whole chromosome loss and associated breakage-fusion-bridge cycles transform mouse tetraploid cells.,The EMBO journal

Here, we report a novel defense mechanism against mycobacterial infection that utilizes the histone methyltransferase, SUV39H1. Normally, a part of the host chromatin, SUV39H1, was also found to be associated with the mycobacterial bacilli during infection. Its binding to bacilli was accompanied by trimethylation of the mycobacterial histone-like protein, HupB, which in turn reduced the cell adhesion capability of the bacilli. Importantly, SUV39H1-mediated methylation of HupB reduced the mycobacterial survival inside the host cell. This was also true in mice infection experiments. In addition, the ability of mycobacteria to form biofilms, a survival strategy of the bacteria dependent upon cell-cell adhesion, was dramatically reduced in the presence of SUV39H1. Thus, this novel defense mechanism against mycobacteria represents a surrogate function of the epigenetic modulator, SUV39H1, and operates by interfering with their cell-cell adhesion ability.",Histone methyltransferase SUV39H1 participates in host defense by methylating mycobacterial histone-like protein HupB.,The EMBO journal

Here, we establish an additional retromer function in controlling the activity and localization of the late endosomal small GTPase RAB7. Surprisingly, we found that RAB7 not only decorates late endosomes or lysosomes, but is also present on the endoplasmic reticulum, trans-Golgi network, and mitochondrial membranes, a localization that is maintained by retromer and the retromer-associated RAB7-specific GAP TBC1D5. In the absence of either TBC1D5 or retromer, RAB7 activity state and localization are no longer controlled and hyperactivated RAB7 expands over the entire lysosomal domain. This lysosomal accumulation of hyperactivated RAB7 results in a striking loss of RAB7 mobility and overall depletion of the inactive RAB7 pool on endomembranes. Functionally, we establish that this control of RAB7 activity is not required for the recycling of retromer-dependent cargoes, but instead enables the correct sorting of the autophagy related transmembrane protein ATG9a and autophagosome formation around damaged mitochondria during Parkin-mediated mitophagy.",Control of RAB7 activity and localization through the retromer-TBC1D5 complex enables RAB7-dependent mitophagy.,The EMBO journal
29150433,"Tyrosine kinases are important regulators of synaptic strength. Here, we describe a key component of the synaptic vesicle release machinery, Munc18-1, as a phosphorylation target for neuronal Src family kinases (SFKs). Phosphomimetic Y473D mutation of a SFK phosphorylation site previously identified by brain phospho-proteomics abolished the stimulatory effect of Munc18-1 on SNARE complex formation (""SNARE-templating"") and membrane fusion in vitro Furthermore, priming but not docking of synaptic vesicles was disrupted in hippocampal munc18-1-null neurons expressing Munc18-1Y473D Synaptic transmission was temporarily restored by high-frequency stimulation, as well as by a Munc18-1 mutation that results in helix 12 extension, a critical conformational step in vesicle priming. On the other hand, expression of non-phosphorylatable Munc18-1 supported normal synaptic transmission. We propose that SFK-dependent Munc18-1 phosphorylation may constitute a potent, previously unknown mechanism to shut down synaptic transmission, via direct occlusion of a Synaptobrevin/VAMP2 binding groove and subsequent hindrance of conformational changes in domain 3a responsible for vesicle priming. This would strongly interfere with the essential post-docking SNARE-templating role of Munc18-1, resulting in a largely abolished pool of releasable synaptic vesicles.",Tyrosine phosphorylation of Munc18-1 inhibits synaptic transmission by preventing SNARE assembly.,The EMBO journal

TBK1 also controls metabolic processes and promotes oncogene-induced cell proliferation and survival. Here, we demonstrate that TBK1 activates mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) directly. In cultured cells, TBK1 associates with and activates mTORC1 through site-specific mTOR phosphorylation (on S2159) in response to certain growth factor receptors (i.e., EGF-receptor but not insulin receptor) and pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) (i.e., TLR3; TLR4), revealing a stimulus-selective role for TBK1 in mTORC1 regulation. By studying cultured macrophages and those isolated from genome edited mTOR S2159A knock-in mice, we show that mTOR S2159 phosphorylation promotes mTORC1 signaling, IRF3 nuclear translocation, and IFN-beta production. These data demonstrate a direct mechanistic link between TBK1 and mTORC1 function as well as physiologic significance of the TBK1-mTORC1 axis in control of innate immune function. These data unveil TBK1 as a direct mTORC1 activator and suggest unanticipated roles for mTORC1 downstream of TBK1 in control of innate immunity, tumorigenesis, and disorders linked to chronic inflammation.",The IKK-related kinase TBK1 activates mTORC1 directly in response to growth factors and innate immune agonists.,The EMBO journal

We previously showed that MCPH1 deletion in neural stem cells results in early mitotic entry that distracts cell division mode, leading to exhaustion of the progenitor pool. Here, we show that MCPH1 interacts with and promotes the E3 ligase betaTrCP2 to degrade Cdc25A independent of DNA damage. Overexpression of betaTrCP2 or the knockdown of Cdc25A remedies the high mitotic index and rescues the premature differentiation of Mcph1-deficient neuroprogenitors in vivo MCPH1 itself is degraded by APC/C(C)(dh1), but not APC/C(C)(dc20), in late mitosis and G1 phase. Forced MCPH1 expression causes cell death, underlining the importance of MCPH1 turnover after mitosis.

Here, we tested and optimized glyoxal fixation and surprisingly found it to be more efficient than PFA-based protocols. Glyoxal acted faster than PFA, cross-linked proteins more effectively, and improved the preservation of cellular morphology. We validated glyoxal fixation in multiple laboratories against different PFA-based protocols and confirmed that it enabled better immunostainings for a majority of the targets.

29141912,"WASP-family proteins are known to promote assembly of branched actin networks by stimulating the filament-nucleating activity of the Arp2/3 complex. Here, we show that WASP-family proteins also function as polymerases that accelerate elongation of uncapped actin filaments. When clustered on a surface, WASP-family proteins can drive branched actin networks to grow much faster than they could by direct incorporation of soluble monomers. This polymerase activity arises from the coordinated action of two regulatory sequences: (i) a WASP homology 2 (WH2) domain that binds actin, and (ii) a proline-rich sequence that binds profilin-actin complexes. In the absence of profilin, WH2 domains are sufficient to accelerate filament elongation, but in the presence of profilin, proline-rich sequences are required to support polymerase activity by (i) bringing polymerization-competent actin monomers in proximity to growing filament ends, and (ii) promoting shuttling of actin monomers from profilin-actin complexes onto nearby WH2 domains. Unoccupied WH2 domains transiently associate with free filament ends, preventing their growth and dynamically tethering the branched actin network to the WASP-family proteins that create it. Collaboration between WH2 and proline-rich sequences thus strikes a balance between filament growth and tethering. Our work expands the number of critical roles that WASP-family proteins play in the assembly of branched actin networks to at least three: (i) promoting dendritic nucleation; (ii) linking actin networks to membranes; and (iii) accelerating filament elongation.",WH2 and proline-rich domains of WASP-family proteins collaborate to accelerate actin filament elongation.,The EMBO journal
29133469,"The Ser/Thr protein kinase PINK1 phosphorylates the well-folded, globular protein ubiquitin (Ub) at a relatively protected site, Ser65. We previously showed that Ser65 phosphorylation results in a conformational change in which Ub adopts a dynamic equilibrium between the known, common Ub conformation and a distinct, second conformation wherein the last beta-strand is retracted to extend the Ser65 loop and shorten the C-terminal tail. We show using chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) nuclear magnetic resonance experiments that a similar, C-terminally retracted (Ub-CR) conformation also exists at low population in wild-type Ub. Point mutations in the moving beta5 and neighbouring beta-strands shift the Ub/Ub-CR equilibrium. This enabled functional studies of the two states, and we show that while the Ub-CR conformation is defective for conjugation, it demonstrates improved binding to PINK1 through its extended Ser65 loop, and is a superior PINK1 substrate. Together our data suggest that PINK1 utilises a lowly populated yet more suitable Ub-CR conformation of Ub for efficient phosphorylation.

Oncogenic levels of MYC reprogram cellular metabolism, a hallmark of cancer development, to sustain the high rate of proliferation of cancer cells. Conversely, cells need to modulate MYC function according to the availability of nutrients, in order to avoid a metabolic collapse. Here, we review recent evidence that the multiple interactions of MYC with cell metabolism are mutual and review mechanisms that control MYC levels and function in response to metabolic stress situations. The main hypothesis we put forward is that regulation of MYC levels is an integral part of the adaptation of cells to nutrient deprivation. Since such mechanisms would be particularly relevant in tumor cells, we propose that-in contrast to growth factor-dependent controls-they are not disrupted during tumorigenesis and that maintaining flexibility of expression is integral to MYC's oncogenic function.",MYC and tumor metabolism: chicken and egg.,The EMBO journal

The molecular chaperone heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is an essential component of the cellular homeostatic machinery in eukaryotes. Here, we show that Tsc1 is a new co-chaperone for Hsp90 that inhibits its ATPase activity. The C-terminal domain of Tsc1 (998-1,164 aa) forms a homodimer and binds to both protomers of the Hsp90 middle domain. This ensures inhibition of both subunits of the Hsp90 dimer and prevents the activating co-chaperone Aha1 from binding the middle domain of Hsp90. Conversely, phosphorylation of Aha1-Y223 increases its affinity for Hsp90 and displaces Tsc1, thereby providing a mechanism for equilibrium between binding of these two co-chaperones to Hsp90. Our findings establish an active role for Tsc1 as a facilitator of Hsp90-mediated folding of kinase and non-kinase clients-including Tsc2-thereby preventing their ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation.",Tumor suppressor Tsc1 is a new Hsp90 co-chaperone that facilitates folding of kinase and non-kinase clients.,The EMBO journal

Despite its key role, its molecular mechanism has remained largely unknown. Here, we employ single-molecule magnetic tweezers to measure, in real time, the compaction of individual DNA molecules by the budding yeast condensin complex. We show that compaction can proceed in large steps, driving DNA molecules into a fully condensed state against forces of up to 2 pN. Compaction can be reversed by applying high forces or adding buffer of high ionic strength. While condensin can stably bind DNA in the absence of ATP, ATP hydrolysis by the SMC subunits is required for rendering the association salt insensitive and for the subsequent compaction process. Our results indicate that the condensin reaction cycle involves two distinct steps, where condensin first binds DNA through electrostatic interactions before using ATP hydrolysis to encircle the DNA topologically within its ring structure, which initiates DNA compaction. The finding that both binding modes are essential for its DNA compaction activity has important implications for understanding the mechanism of chromosome compaction.",Real-time detection of condensin-driven DNA compaction reveals a multistep binding mechanism.,The EMBO journal

Our NMR structural analysis identified E17 within the PSD-95 N-terminus as important for binding to Ca(2+)/CaM by interacting with R126 on CaM. Mutating E17 to R prevented homeostatic scaling down in primary hippocampal neurons, which is rescued via charge inversion by ectopic expression of CaM(R)(126E), as determined by analysis of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents.

We dissected T3S substrate targeting and hierarchical switching by reconstituting them in vitro using inverted inner membrane vesicles. EscV recruits and conformationally activates the tightly membrane-associated pseudo-effector SepL and its chaperone SepD. This renders SepL a high-affinity receptor for translocator/chaperone pairs, recognizing specific chaperone signals. In a second, SepD-coupled step, translocators docked on SepL become secreted. During translocator secretion, SepL/SepD suppress effector/chaperone binding to EscV and prevent premature effector secretion. Disengagement of the SepL/SepD switch directs EscV to dedicated effector export.

Here, we determined the genetic requirements for the repair of CRISPR/Cas9-induced chromosomal breaks of different configurations, and establish the mutational consequences. We find that cNHEJ and polymerase theta-mediated end-joining (TMEJ) act both parallel and redundant in mouse embryonic stem cells and account for virtually all end-joining activity. Surprisingly, mutagenic repair by polymerase theta (Pol theta, encoded by the Polq gene) is most prevalent for blunt double-strand breaks (DSBs), while cNHEJ dictates mutagenic repair of DSBs with protruding ends, in which the cNHEJ polymerases lambda and mu play minor roles.

Here, we have compared the activity of individual DNMT3A isoforms in mouse embryonic stem and neuronal progenitor cells and report that these isoforms differ in their genomic binding and DNA methylation activity at regulatory sites. We identify that the longer isoform DNMT3A1 preferentially localizes to the methylated shores of bivalent CpG island promoters in a tissue-specific manner. The isoform-specific targeting of DNMT3A1 coincides with elevated hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) deposition, suggesting an involvement of this isoform in mediating turnover of DNA methylation at these sites.

To understand how THO restrains harmful R-loops, we searched for new THO-interacting factors. We found that human THO interacts with the Sin3A histone deacetylase complex to suppress co-transcriptional R-loops, DNA damage, and replication impairment. Functional analyses show that histone hypo-acetylation prevents accumulation of harmful R-loops and RNA-mediated genomic instability. Diminished histone deacetylase activity in THO- and Sin3A-depleted cell lines correlates with increased R-loop formation, genomic instability, and replication fork stalling.

Microbial infections often deplete homeostatic chemokines; it is thought that infection-inflicted destruction of stromal cells results in the downregulation of these chemokines. Whether inflammation per se also regulates these processes remains unclear. We show that TNF accumulated upon non-infectious immunization of mice similarly downregulates the expressions of these chemokines and consequently diminishes the ingress of naive lymphocytes in inflamed SLOs. Mechanistically, TNF inactivated NIK in LTbetaR-stimulated cells and induced the synthesis of Nfkb2 mRNA encoding p100; these together potently accumulated unprocessed p100, which attenuated the RelB activity as inhibitory IkappaBdelta. Finally, a lack of p100 alleviated these TNF-mediated inhibitions in inflamed SLOs of immunized Nfkb2(-/-) mice.

29046334,"The maxi-anion channels (MACs) are expressed in cells from mammals to amphibians with ~60% exhibiting a phenotype called Maxi-Cl. Maxi-Cl serves as the most efficient pathway for regulated fluxes of inorganic and organic anions including ATP However, its molecular entity has long been elusive. By subjecting proteins isolated from bleb membranes rich in Maxi-Cl activity to LC-MS/MS combined with targeted siRNA screening, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout, and heterologous overexpression, we identified the organic anion transporter SLCO2A1, known as a prostaglandin transporter (PGT), as a key component of Maxi-Cl. Recombinant SLCO2A1 exhibited Maxi-Cl activity in reconstituted proteoliposomes. When SLCO2A1, but not its two disease-causing mutants, was heterologously expressed in cells which lack endogenous SLCO2A1 expression and Maxi-Cl activity, Maxi-Cl currents became activated. The charge-neutralized mutant became weakly cation-selective with exhibiting a smaller single-channel conductance. Slco2a1 silencing in vitro and in vivo, respectively, suppressed the release of ATP from swollen C127 cells and from Langendorff-perfused mouse hearts subjected to ischemia-reperfusion. These findings indicate that SLCO2A1 is an essential core component of the ATP-conductive Maxi-Cl channel.",The organic anion transporter SLCO2A1 constitutes the core component of the Maxi-Cl channel.,The EMBO journal
29046333,"The tumor suppressor p53 is activated in response to cellular stress to prevent malignant transformation. However, several recent studies have shown that p53 can play protective roles in tumor cell survival under adversity. Whether p53-regulated long noncoding RNAs are involved in this process remains to be fully understood. Here, we show that under glucose starvation condition, p53 directly upregulates a novel lncRNA named TRINGS (Tp53-regulated inhibitor of necrosis under glucose starvation) in human tumor cells. TRINGS binds to STRAP and inhibits STRAP-GSK3beta-NF-kappaB necrotic signaling to protect tumor cells from cell death. Interestingly, TRINGS appears to respond to glucose starvation specifically, as it is not activated by serum, serine, or glutamine deprivation. Collectively, our findings reveal that p53-induced lncRNA TRINGS controls the necrotic pathway and contributes to the survival of cancer cells harboring wild-type p53 under glucose stress.",The p53-inducible long noncoding RNA TRINGS protects cancer cells from necrosis under glucose starvation.,The EMBO journal
29038174,"Accumulation of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) associates with malignant progression in cancer. However, the mechanisms that drive the pro-tumor functions of TAMs are not fully understood. ZEB1 is best known for driving an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer cells to promote tumor progression. However, a role for ZEB1 in macrophages and TAMs has not been studied. Here we describe that TAMs require ZEB1 for their tumor-promoting and chemotherapy resistance functions in a mouse model of ovarian cancer. Only TAMs that expressed full levels of Zeb1 accelerated tumor growth. Mechanistically, ZEB1 expression in TAMs induced their polarization toward an F4/80(low) pro-tumor phenotype, including direct activation of Ccr2 In turn, expression of ZEB1 by TAMs induced Ccl2, Cd74, and a mesenchymal/stem-like phenotype in cancer cells. In human ovarian carcinomas, TAM infiltration and CCR2 expression correlated with ZEB1 in tumor cells, where along with CCL2 and CD74 determined poorer prognosis. Importantly, ZEB1 in TAMs was a factor of poorer survival in human ovarian carcinomas. These data establish ZEB1 as a key factor in the tumor microenvironment and for maintaining TAMs' tumor-promoting functions.",Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) depend on ZEB1 for their cancer-promoting roles.,The EMBO journal
29038173,"Cytoplasmic dynein is involved in a multitude of essential cellular functions. Dynein's activity is controlled by the combinatorial action of several regulatory proteins. The molecular mechanism of this regulation is still poorly understood. Using purified proteins, we reconstitute the regulation of the human dynein complex by three prominent regulators on dynamic microtubules in the presence of end binding proteins (EBs). We find that dynein can be in biochemically and functionally distinct pools: either tracking dynamic microtubule plus-ends in an EB-dependent manner or moving processively towards minus ends in an adaptor protein-dependent manner. Whereas both dynein pools share the dynactin complex, they have opposite preferences for binding other regulators, either the adaptor protein Bicaudal-D2 (BicD2) or the multifunctional regulator Lissencephaly-1 (Lis1). BicD2 and Lis1 together control the overall efficiency of motility initiation. Remarkably, dynactin can bias motility initiation locally from microtubule plus ends by autonomous plus-end recognition. This bias is further enhanced by EBs and Lis1. Our study provides insight into the mechanism of dynein regulation by dissecting the distinct functional contributions of the individual members of a dynein regulatory network.",Combinatorial regulation of the balance between dynein microtubule end accumulation and initiation of directed motility.,The EMBO journal

Here, we describe the heterogeneity of a B220(+)CD117(int)CD19(-)NK1.1(-) uncommitted hematopoietic progenitor having combined lymphoid and myeloid potential. Phenotypic and functional assays revealed four subpopulations within the progenitor with distinct lineage developmental potentials. Among them, the Ly6D(+)SiglecH(-)CD11c(-) fraction was lymphoid-restricted exhibiting strong B-cell potential, whereas the Ly6D(-)SiglecH(-)CD11c(-) fraction showed mixed lympho-myeloid potential. Single-cell RNA sequencing of these subsets revealed that the latter population comprised a mixture of cells with distinct lymphoid and myeloid transcriptional signatures and identified a subgroup as the potential precursor of Ly6D(+)SiglecH(-)CD11c(-) Subsequent functional assays confirmed that B220(+)CD117(int)CD19(-)NK1.1(-) single cells are, with rare exceptions, not bipotent for lymphoid and myeloid lineages. A B-cell priming gradient was observed within the Ly6D(+)SiglecH(-)CD11c(-) subset and we propose a herein newly identified subgroup as the direct precursor of the first B-cell committed stage. Therefore, the apparent multipotency of B220(+)CD117(int)CD19(-)NK1.1(-) progenitors results from underlying heterogeneity at the single-cell level and highlights the validity of single-cell transcriptomics for resolving cellular heterogeneity and developmental relationships among hematopoietic progenitors.",Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals developmental heterogeneity among early lymphoid progenitors.,The EMBO journal
29030485,"Toxoplasma gondii encodes three protein kinase A catalytic (PKAc1-3) and one regulatory (PKAr) subunits to integrate cAMP-dependent signals. Here, we show that inactive PKAc1 is maintained at the parasite pellicle by interacting with acylated PKAr. Either a conditional knockdown of PKAr or the overexpression of PKAc1 blocks parasite division. Conversely, down-regulation of PKAc1 or stabilisation of a dominant-negative PKAr isoform that does not bind cAMP triggers premature parasite egress from infected cells followed by serial invasion attempts leading to host cell lysis. This untimely egress depends on host cell acidification. A phosphoproteome analysis suggested the interplay between cAMP and cGMP signalling as PKAc1 inactivation changes the phosphorylation profile of a putative cGMP-phosphodiesterase. Concordantly, inhibition of the cGMP-dependent protein kinase G (PKG) blocks egress induced by PKAc1 inactivation or environmental acidification, while a cGMP-phosphodiesterase inhibitor circumvents egress repression by PKAc1 or pH neutralisation. This indicates that pH and PKAc1 act as balancing regulators of cGMP metabolism to control egress. These results reveal a crosstalk between PKA and PKG pathways to govern egress in T. gondii.",Crosstalk between PKA and PKG controls pH-dependent host cell egress of Toxoplasma gondii.,The EMBO journal
29030484,"PIWI proteins play essential roles in germ cells and stem cell lineages. In Drosophila, Piwi is required in somatic niche cells and germline stem cells (GSCs) to support GSC self-renewal and differentiation. Whether and how other PIWI proteins are involved in GSC biology remains unknown. Here, we show that Aubergine (Aub), another PIWI protein, is intrinsically required in GSCs for their self-renewal and differentiation. Aub needs to be loaded with piRNAs to control GSC self-renewal and acts through direct mRNA regulation. We identify the Cbl proto-oncogene, a regulator of mammalian hematopoietic stem cells, as a novel GSC differentiation factor. Aub stimulates GSC self-renewal by repressing Cbl mRNA translation and does so in part through recruitment of the CCR4-NOT complex. This study reveals the role of piRNAs and PIWI proteins in controlling stem cell homeostasis via translational repression and highlights piRNAs as major post-transcriptional regulators in key developmental decisions.",Aubergine and piRNAs promote germline stem cell self-renewal by repressing the proto-oncogene Cbl.,The EMBO journal
29030483,"Notch signaling is an evolutionarily conserved signal transduction pathway that is essential for metazoan development. Upon ligand binding, the Notch intracellular domain (NOTCH ICD) translocates into the nucleus and forms a complex with the transcription factor RBPJ (also known as CBF1 or CSL) to activate expression of Notch target genes. In the absence of a Notch signal, RBPJ acts as a transcriptional repressor. Using a proteomic approach, we identified L3MBTL3 (also known as MBT1) as a novel RBPJ interactor. L3MBTL3 competes with NOTCH ICD for binding to RBPJ In the absence of NOTCH ICD, RBPJ recruits L3MBTL3 and the histone demethylase KDM1A (also known as LSD1) to the enhancers of Notch target genes, leading to H3K4me2 demethylation and to transcriptional repression. Importantly, in vivo analyses of the homologs of RBPJ and L3MBTL3 in Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans demonstrate that the functional link between RBPJ and L3MBTL3 is evolutionarily conserved, thus identifying L3MBTL3 as a universal modulator of Notch signaling in metazoans.",RBPJ/CBF1 interacts with L3MBTL3/MBT1 to promote repression of Notch signaling via histone demethylase KDM1A/LSD1.,The EMBO journal
29030482,"Sorting, transport, and autophagic degradation of proteins in endosomes and lysosomes, as well as the division of these organelles, depend on scission of membrane-bound tubulo-vesicular carriers. How scission occurs is poorly understood, but family proteins bind these membranes. Here, we show that the yeast PROPPIN Atg18 carries membrane scission activity. Purified Atg18 drives tubulation and scission of giant unilamellar vesicles. Upon membrane contact, Atg18 folds its unstructured CD loop into an amphipathic alpha-helix that inserts into the bilayer. This allows the protein to engage its two lipid binding sites for PI3P and PI(3,5)P2 PI(3,5)P2 induces Atg18 oligomerization, which should concentrate lipid-inserted alpha-helices in the outer membrane leaflet and drive membrane tubulation and scission. The scission activity of Atg18 is compatible with its known roles in endo-lysosomal protein trafficking, autophagosome biogenesis, and vacuole fission. Key features required for membrane tubulation and scission by Atg18 are shared by other PROPPINs, suggesting that membrane scission may be a generic function of this protein family.",Membrane scission driven by the PROPPIN Atg18.,The EMBO journal
29021282,"Methionine metabolism is critical for epigenetic maintenance, redox homeostasis, and animal development. However, the regulation of methionine metabolism remains unclear. Here, we provide evidence that SIRT1, the most conserved mammalian NAD(+)-dependent protein deacetylase, is critically involved in modulating methionine metabolism, thereby impacting maintenance of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) and subsequent embryogenesis. We demonstrate that SIRT1-deficient mESCs are hypersensitive to methionine restriction/depletion-induced differentiation and apoptosis, primarily due to a reduced conversion of methionine to S-adenosylmethionine. This reduction markedly decreases methylation levels of histones, resulting in dramatic alterations in gene expression profiles. Mechanistically, we discover that the enzyme converting methionine to S-adenosylmethionine in mESCs, methionine adenosyltransferase 2a (MAT2a), is under control of Myc and SIRT1. Consistently, SIRT1 KO embryos display reduced Mat2a expression and histone methylation and are sensitive to maternal methionine restriction-induced lethality, whereas maternal methionine supplementation increases the survival of SIRT1 KO newborn mice. Our findings uncover a novel regulatory mechanism for methionine metabolism and highlight the importance of methionine metabolism in SIRT1-mediated mESC maintenance and embryonic development.",Methionine metabolism is essential for SIRT1-regulated mouse embryonic stem cell maintenance and embryonic development.,The EMBO journal
29018038,"In the amyloidogenic pathway associated with Alzheimer disease (AD), the amyloid precursor protein (APP) is cleaved by beta-secretase to generate a 99-aa C-terminal fragment (C99) that is then cleaved by gamma-secretase to generate the beta-amyloid (Abeta) found in senile plaques. In previous reports, we and others have shown that gamma-secretase activity is enriched in mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes (MAM) and that ER-mitochondrial connectivity and MAM function are upregulated in AD We now show that C99, in addition to its localization in endosomes, can also be found in MAM, where it is normally processed rapidly by gamma-secretase. In cell models of AD, however, the concentration of unprocessed C99 increases in MAM regions, resulting in elevated sphingolipid turnover and an altered lipid composition of both MAM and mitochondrial membranes. In turn, this change in mitochondrial membrane composition interferes with the proper assembly and activity of mitochondrial respiratory supercomplexes, thereby likely contributing to the bioenergetic defects characteristic of AD.",Increased localization of APP-C99 in mitochondria-associated ER membranes causes mitochondrial dysfunction in Alzheimer disease.,The EMBO journal

How global-genome nucleotide excision repair (GG-NER) processes CPDs despite that this chromatin arrangement is poorly understood. An increased chromatin association of CHD1 (chromodomain helicase DNA-binding 1) upon UV irradiation indicated possible roles of this chromatin remodeler in the UV damage response. Immunoprecipitation of chromatin fragments revealed that CHD1 co-localizes in part with GG-NER factors. Chromatin fractionation showed that the UV-dependent recruitment of CHD1 occurs to UV lesions in histone-assembled nucleosomal DNA and that this CHD1 relocation requires the lesion sensor XPC (xeroderma pigmentosum group C). In situ immunofluorescence analyses further demonstrate that CHD1 facilitates substrate handover from XPC to the downstream TFIIH (transcription factor IIH). Consequently, CHD1 depletion slows down CPD excision and sensitizes cells to UV-induced cytotoxicity. The finding of a CHD1-driven lesion handover between sequentially acting GG-NER factors on nucleosomal histone octamers suggests that chromatin provides a recognition scaffold enabling the detection of a subset of CPDs.",Chromatin remodeler CHD1 promotes XPC-to-TFIIH handover of nucleosomal UV lesions in nucleotide excision repair.,The EMBO journal

This dynamics is determined by the balance of nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, formin- and redox-dependent filament polymerisation. Here, using Xenopus egg extracts and human somatic cells, we show that actin dynamics and formins are essential for DNA replication. In proliferating cells, formin inhibition abolishes nuclear transport and initiation of DNA replication, as well as general transcription. In replicating nuclei from transcriptionally silent Xenopus egg extracts, we identified numerous actin regulators, and disruption of actin dynamics abrogates nuclear transport, preventing NLS (nuclear localisation signal)-cargo release from RanGTP-importin complexes. Nuclear formin activity is further required to promote loading of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) onto chromatin, as well as initiation and elongation of DNA replication. Therefore, actin dynamics and formins control DNA replication by multiple direct and indirect mechanisms.",Initiation of DNA replication requires actin dynamics and formin activity.,The EMBO journal
28978671,"While beta-catenin has been demonstrated as an essential molecule and therapeutic target for various cancer stem cells (CSCs) including those driven by MLL fusions, here we show that transcriptional memory from cells of origin predicts AML patient survival and allows beta-catenin-independent transformation in MLL-CSCs derived from hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)-enriched LSK population but not myeloid-granulocyte progenitors. Mechanistically, beta-catenin regulates expression of downstream targets of a key transcriptional memory gene, Hoxa9 that is highly enriched in LSK-derived MLL-CSCs and helps sustain leukemic self-renewal. Suppression of Hoxa9 sensitizes LSK-derived MLL-CSCs to beta-catenin inhibition resulting in abolishment of CSC transcriptional program and transformation ability. In addition, further molecular and functional analyses identified Prmt1 as a key common downstream mediator for beta-catenin/Hoxa9 functions in LSK-derived MLL-CSCs. Together, these findings not only uncover an unexpectedly important role of cells of origin transcriptional memory in regulating CSC self-renewal, but also reveal a novel molecular network mediated by beta-catenin/Hoxa9/Prmt1 in governing leukemic self-renewal.",Transcriptional memory of cells of origin overrides beta-catenin requirement of MLL cancer stem cells.,The EMBO journal
28978670,"The network of proteins that orchestrate the distribution of cholesterol among cellular organelles is not fully characterized. We previously proposed that oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) drives cholesterol/PI4P exchange at contact sites between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the trans-Golgi network (TGN). Using the inhibitor OSW-1, we report here that the sole activity of endogenous OSBP makes a major contribution to cholesterol distribution, lipid order, and PI4P turnover in living cells. Blocking OSBP causes accumulation of sterols at ER/lipid droplets at the expense of TGN, thereby reducing the gradient of lipid order along the secretory pathway. OSBP consumes about half of the total cellular pool of PI4P, a consumption that depends on the amount of cholesterol to be transported. Inhibiting the spatially restricted PI4-kinase PI4KIIIbeta triggers large periodic traveling waves of PI4P across the TGN These waves are cadenced by long-range PI4P production by PI4KIIalpha and PI4P consumption by OSBP Collectively, these data indicate a massive spatiotemporal coupling between cholesterol transport and PI4P turnover via OSBP and PI4-kinases to control the lipid composition of subcellular membranes.","Sterol transfer, PI4P consumption, and control of membrane lipid order by endogenous OSBP.",The EMBO journal

MT severing specifically occurs at crossover or branching nucleation sites in living Arabidopsis cells. This differs from the random severing observed along the entire length of single MTs in vitro and strongly suggests that a precise control mechanism must exist in vivo However, how katanin senses and cleaves at MT crossover and branching nucleation sites in vivo has remained unknown. Here, we show that the katanin p80 subunit KTN80 confers precision to MT severing by specific targeting of the katanin p60 subunit KTN1 to MT cleavage sites and that KTN1 is required for oligomerization of functional KTN80-KTN1 complexes that catalyze severing. Moreover, our findings suggest that the katanin complex in Arabidopsis is composed of a hexamer of KTN1-KTN80 heterodimers that sense MT geometry to confer precise MT severing.

In mice, detection of the AP 2-sec-butyl-4,5-dihydrothiazole (SBT) is mediated by chemosensory neurons residing in the Grueneberg ganglion (GG) of the anterior nasal region. Although the molecular mechanisms underlying activation of GG neurons by SBT and other substances are still unclear, recent studies have reported an involvement of the transmembrane guanylyl cyclase (GC) subtype GC-G in chemosensory signaling in the GG Here, we show that SBT directly binds with high affinity to the extracellular domain of GC-G and elicits an enhanced enzymatic activity of this protein. In line with this finding, heterologous expression of GC-G renders cells responsive to SBT while activation by SBT was strongly attenuated in GG neurons from GC-G-deficient mice. Consistently, SBT-induced fear-associated behaviors, SBT-evoked elevated blood pressure, and increased serum levels of the stress hormone corticosterone were clearly reduced in GC-G-knockout animals compared to wild-type mice.

Although known to play an important role in brain development, their exact function has not been fully described. Here, we show that in contrast to healthy adult and inflammation-activated cells, neonatal microglia show a unique myelinogenic and neurogenic phenotype. A CD11c(+) microglial subset that predominates in primary myelinating areas of the developing brain expresses genes for neuronal and glial survival, migration, and differentiation. These cells are the major source of insulin-like growth factor 1, and its selective depletion from CD11c(+) microglia leads to impairment of primary myelination. CD11c-targeted toxin regimens induced a selective transcriptional response in neonates, distinct from adult microglia. CD11c(+) microglia are also found in clusters of repopulating microglia after experimental ablation and in neuroinflammation in adult mice, but despite some similarities, they do not recapitulate neonatal microglial characteristics. We therefore identify a unique phenotype of neonatal microglia that deliver signals necessary for myelination and neurogenesis.",A novel microglial subset plays a key role in myelinogenesis in developing brain.,The EMBO journal

In this study, we report that lncRNA breast cancer anti-estrogen resistance 4 (BCAR4) is required for YAP-dependent glycolysis. Mechanistically, YAP promotes the expression of BCAR4, which subsequently coordinates the Hedgehog signaling to enhance the transcription of glycolysis activators HK2 and PFKFB3. Therapeutic delivery of locked nucleic acids (LNAs) targeting BCAR4 attenuated YAP-dependent glycolysis and tumor growth. The expression levels of BCAR4 and YAP are positively correlated in tissue samples from breast cancer patients, where high expression of both BCAR4 and YAP is associated with poor patient survival outcome.

Co-ablation of CKIdelta/epsilon in the mouse gut epithelium results in rapid ISC elimination, with subsequent growth arrest, crypt-villous shrinking, and rapid mouse death. Unexpectedly, Wnt activation is preserved in all CKIdelta/epsilon-deficient enterocyte populations, with the exception of Lgr5(+) ISCs, which exhibit Dvl2-dependent Wnt signaling attenuation.

Spliceosomes must ensure accurate removal of highly diverse introns. We show that Sde2 is a ubiquitin-fold-containing splicing regulator that supports splicing of selected pre-mRNAs in an intron-specific manner in Schizosaccharomyces pombe Both fission yeast and human Sde2 are translated as inactive precursor proteins harbouring the ubiquitin-fold domain linked through an invariant GGKGG motif to a C-terminal domain (referred to as Sde2-C). Precursor processing after the first di-glycine motif by the ubiquitin-specific proteases Ubp5 and Ubp15 generates a short-lived activated Sde2-C fragment with an N-terminal lysine residue, which subsequently gets incorporated into spliceosomes. Absence of Sde2 or defects in Sde2 activation both result in inefficient excision of selected introns from a subset of pre-mRNAs. Sde2 facilitates spliceosomal association of Cactin/Cay1, with a functional link between Sde2 and Cactin further supported by genetic interactions and pre-mRNA splicing assays.

These exciting advances reveal the complexity of the pathogenic mechanisms of FTD and ALS and suggest promising molecular targets for future therapeutic interventions in these devastating disorders.",Dysregulated molecular pathways in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-frontotemporal dementia spectrum disorder.,The EMBO journal
28899900,"Expression of the Ret receptor tyrosine kinase is a defining feature of enteric neurons. Its importance is underscored by the effects of its mutation in Hirschsprung disease, leading to absence of gut innervation and severe gastrointestinal symptoms. We report a new and physiologically significant site of Ret expression in the intestine: the intestinal epithelium. Experiments in Drosophila indicate that Ret is expressed both by enteric neurons and adult intestinal epithelial progenitors, which require Ret to sustain their proliferation. Mechanistically, Ret is engaged in a positive feedback loop with Wnt/Wingless signalling, modulated by Src and Fak kinases. We find that Ret is also expressed by the developing intestinal epithelium of mice, where its expression is maintained into the adult stage in a subset of enteroendocrine/enterochromaffin cells. Mouse organoid experiments point to an intrinsic role for Ret in promoting epithelial maturation and regulating Wnt signalling. Our findings reveal evolutionary conservation of the positive Ret/Wnt signalling feedback in both developmental and homeostatic contexts. They also suggest an epithelial contribution to Ret loss-of-function disorders such as Hirschsprung disease.",Ret receptor tyrosine kinase sustains proliferation and tissue maturation in intestinal epithelia.,The EMBO journal
28899899,"Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is a cellular surveillance pathway that recognizes and degrades mRNAs with premature termination codons (PTCs). The mechanisms underlying translation termination are key to the understanding of RNA surveillance mechanisms such as NMD and crucial for the development of therapeutic strategies for NMD-related diseases. Here, we have used a fully reconstituted in vitro translation system to probe the NMD proteins for interaction with the termination apparatus. We discovered that UPF3B (i) interacts with the release factors, (ii) delays translation termination and (iii) dissociates post-termination ribosomal complexes that are devoid of the nascent peptide. Furthermore, we identified UPF1 and ribosomes as new interaction partners of UPF3B. These previously unknown functions of UPF3B during the early and late phases of translation termination suggest that UPF3B is involved in the crosstalk between the NMD machinery and the PTC-bound ribosome, a central mechanistic step of RNA surveillance.",Dual function of UPF3B in early and late translation termination.,The EMBO journal
28882847,"DNA methylation is a major epigenetic modification; however, the precise role of DNA methylation in vertebrate development is still not fully understood. Here, we show that DNA methylation is essential for the establishment of the left-right (LR) asymmetric body plan during vertebrate embryogenesis. Perturbation of DNA methylation by depletion of DNA methyltransferase 1 (dnmt1) or dnmt3bb.1 in zebrafish embryos leads to defects in dorsal forerunner cell (DFC) specification or collective migration, laterality organ malformation, and disruption of LR patterning. Knockdown of dnmt1 in Xenopus embryos also causes similar defects. Mechanistically, loss of dnmt1 function induces hypomethylation of the lefty2 gene enhancer and promotes lefty2 expression, which consequently represses Nodal signaling in zebrafish embryos. We also show that Dnmt3bb.1 regulates collective DFC migration through cadherin 1 (Cdh1). Taken together, our data uncover dynamic DNA methylation as an epigenetic mechanism to control LR determination during early embryogenesis in vertebrates.",Epigenetic regulation of left-right asymmetry by DNA methylation.,The EMBO journal

Here, we show that the BLM-TOP3A-RMI (BTR) dissolvase complex is required for ALT-mediated telomere synthesis. We propose that recombination intermediates formed during strand invasion are processed by the BTR complex, initiating rapid and extensive POLD3-dependent telomere synthesis followed by dissolution, with no overall exchange of telomeric DNA. This process is counteracted by the SLX4-SLX1-ERCC4 complex, which promotes resolution of the recombination intermediate, resulting in telomere exchange in the absence of telomere extension. Our data are consistent with ALT being a conservative DNA replication process, analogous to break-induced replication, which is dependent on BTR and counteracted by SLX4 complex-mediated resolution events.",BLM and SLX4 play opposing roles in recombination-dependent replication at human telomeres.,The EMBO journal

While critical in recruiting Pol II to the promoter, the role transcription factors play in transitioning paused Pol II into productive Pol II is, however, little known. By studying how Drosophila Hox transcription factors control transcription, we uncovered a molecular mechanism that increases productive transcription. We found that the Hox proteins AbdA and Ubx target gene promoters previously bound by the transcription pausing factor M1BP, containing paused Pol II and enriched with promoter-proximal Polycomb Group (PcG) proteins, yet lacking the classical H3K27me3 PcG signature. We found that AbdA binding to M1BP-regulated genes results in reduction in PcG binding, the release of paused Pol II, increases in promoter H3K4me3 histone marks and increased gene transcription. Linking transcription factors, PcG proteins and paused Pol II states, these data identify a two-step mechanism of Hox-driven transcription, with M1BP binding leading to Pol II recruitment followed by AbdA targeting, which results in a change in the chromatin landscape and enhanced transcription.",The Hox proteins Ubx and AbdA collaborate with the transcription pausing factor M1BP to regulate gene transcription.,The EMBO journal

These peptides are also toxic to the producing bacteria that utilize dedicated ABC transporters to provide self-immunity. The ABC transporter McjD exports the antibacterial peptide MccJ25 in Escherichia coli Our previously determined McjD structure provided some mechanistic insights into antibacterial peptide efflux. In this study, we have determined its structure in a novel conformation, apo inward-occluded and a new nucleotide-bound state, high-energy outward-occluded intermediate state, with a defined ligand binding cavity. Predictive cysteine cross-linking in E. coli membranes and PELDOR measurements along the transport cycle indicate that McjD does not undergo major conformational changes as previously proposed for multi-drug ABC exporters. Combined with transport assays and molecular dynamics simulations, we propose a novel mechanism for toxic peptide ABC exporters that only requires the transient opening of the cavity for release of the peptide. We propose that shielding of the cavity ensures that the transporter is available to export the newly synthesized peptides, preventing toxic-level build-up.",Structural basis for antibacterial peptide self-immunity by the bacterial ABC transporter McjD.,The EMBO journal

In Alzheimer's disease (AD), the axonally enriched protein Tau forms hyperphosphorylated aggregates in the somatodendritic domain. Consequently, a process of subcellular relocalization driven by Tau phosphorylation and detachment from microtubules has been proposed. Here, we reveal an alternative mechanism of de novo protein synthesis of Tau and its hyperphosphorylation in the somatodendritic domain, induced by oligomeric amyloid-beta (Abeta) and mediated by the kinase Fyn that activates the ERK/S6 signaling pathway. Activation of this pathway is demonstrated in a range of cellular systems, and in vivo in brains from Abeta-depositing, Abeta-injected, and Fyn-overexpressing mice with Tau accumulation. Both pharmacological inhibition and genetic deletion of Fyn abolish the Abeta-induced Tau overexpression via ERK/S6 suppression. Together, these findings present a more cogent mechanism of Tau aggregation in disease.

Polymorphisms in IFIH1, the gene coding for MDA5, correlate with the risk of developing type 1 diabetes (T1D). Here, we demonstrate that MDA5 is crucial for the immune response to enteric rotavirus infection, a proposed etiological agent for T1D. MDA5 variants encoded by minor IFIH1 alleles associated with lower T1D risk exhibit reduced activity against rotavirus infection. We find that MDA5 activity limits rotavirus infection not only through the induction of antiviral interferons and pro-inflammatory cytokines, but also by promoting cell death. Importantly, this MDA5-dependent antiviral response is specific to the pancreas of rotavirus-infected mice, similar to the autoimmunity associated with T1D. These findings imply that MDA5-induced cell death and inflammation in the pancreas facilitate progression to autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta-cells.",The innate immune receptor MDA5 limits rotavirus infection but promotes cell death and pancreatic inflammation.,The EMBO journal

Recent studies have identified autophagy receptors that facilitate this process by binding to ubiquitinated targets, including NDP52. Here, we demonstrate that the small guanosine triphosphatase Rab35 directs NDP52 to the corresponding targets of multiple forms of autophagy. The active GTP-bound form of Rab35 accumulates on bacteria-containing endosomes, and Rab35 directly binds and recruits NDP52 to internalized bacteria. Additionally, Rab35 promotes interaction of NDP52 with ubiquitin. This process is inhibited by TBC1D10A, a GAP that inactivates Rab35, but stimulated by autophagic activation via TBK1 kinase, which associates with NDP52. Rab35, TBC1D10A, and TBK1 regulate NDP52 recruitment to damaged mitochondria and to autophagosomes to promote mitophagy and maturation of autophagosomes, respectively.

Here, we show that different forms of reactive oxygen species (ROS) have antagonistic roles in plant stem cell regulation, which were established by distinct spatiotemporal patterns of ROS-metabolizing enzymes. The superoxide anion (O2.-) is markedly enriched in stem cells to activate WUSCHEL and maintain stemness, whereas H2O2 is more abundant in the differentiating peripheral zone to promote stem cell differentiation. Moreover, H2O2 negatively regulates O2.- biosynthesis in stem cells, and increasing H2O2 levels or scavenging O2.- leads to the termination of stem cells.

Spo0A~P, in turn, sets in motion events that lead to asymmetric division and activation of the cell-specific transcription factor sigma(F), a hallmark for entry into sporulation. Here, we have used a microfluidics-based platform to investigate the activation of Spo0A and sigma(F) in individual cells held under constant, sporulation-inducing conditions. The principal conclusions were that: (i) activation of sigma(F) occurs with an approximately constant probability after adaptation to conditions of nutrient limitation; (ii) activation of sigma(F) is tightly correlated with, and preceded by, Spo0A~P reaching a high threshold level; (iii) activation of Spo0A takes place abruptly just prior to asymmetric division; and (iv) the primary source of noise in the activation of Spo0A is the phosphorelay.

In this study, we present the first quantitative human genome-wide map of DNA lesions induced by ultraviolet (UV) radiation, the ubiquitous carcinogen in sunlight that causes skin cancer. Remarkably, the pattern of carcinogen susceptibility across the genome of primary cells significantly reflects mutation frequency in malignant melanoma. Surprisingly, DNase-accessible euchromatin is protected from UV, while lamina-associated heterochromatin at the nuclear periphery is vulnerable. Many cancer driver genes have an intrinsic increase in carcinogen susceptibility, including the BRAF oncogene that has the highest mutation frequency in melanoma.

We named this mechanism the ETI-Mediating and PTI-Inhibited Sector (EMPIS). The signaling kinetics of EMPIS explain apparently different plant genetic requirements for ETI triggered by different effectors without postulating different signaling machineries.

Furthermore, we provide several lines of evidence indicating that hMTR4 executes this role by directly competing with the mRNA export adaptor ALYREF for associating with ARS2, a component of the cap-binding complex (CBC), and this competition is critical for determining whether an RNA is degraded or exported to the cytoplasm.

Using quantitative high-resolution mass spectrometry, we demonstrate that TRPC1, TRPC4, and TRPC5 assemble into heteromultimers with each other, but not with other TRP family members in the mouse brain and hippocampus. In hippocampal neurons from Trpc1/Trpc4/Trpc5-triple-knockout (Trpc1/4/5(-/-)) mice, lacking any TRPC1-, TRPC4-, or TRPC5-containing channels, action potential-triggered excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were significantly reduced, whereas frequency, amplitude, and kinetics of quantal miniature EPSC signaling remained unchanged. Likewise, evoked postsynaptic responses in hippocampal slice recordings and transient potentiation after tetanic stimulation were decreased. In vivo, Trpc1/4/5(-/-) mice displayed impaired cross-frequency coupling in hippocampal networks and deficits in spatial working memory, while spatial reference memory was unaltered. Trpc1/4/5(-/-) animals also exhibited deficiencies in adapting to a new challenge in a relearning task.

Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy demonstrates the intrinsically disordered structure of FUS LC is preserved after phosphorylation; however, transient domain collapse and self-interaction are reduced by phosphomimetics. Moreover, we show that phosphomimetic FUS reduces aggregation in human and yeast cell models, and can ameliorate FUS-associated cytotoxicity.

Although these enzymes have been implicated in control of replication origins, the specific contribution of H4K20 methylation to DNA replication remains unclear. Here, we show that H4K20 mutation in mammalian cells, unlike in Drosophila, partially impairs S-phase progression and protects from DNA re-replication induced by stabilization of PR-Set7. Using Epstein-Barr virus-derived episomes, we further demonstrate that conversion of H4K20me1 to higher H4K20me2/3 states by Suv4-20h is not sufficient to define an efficient origin per se, but rather serves as an enhancer for MCM2-7 helicase loading and replication activation at defined origins. Consistent with this, we find that Suv4-20h-mediated H4K20 tri-methylation (H4K20me3) is required to sustain the licensing and activity of a subset of ORCA/LRWD1-associated origins, which ensure proper replication timing of late-replicating heterochromatin domains.

Overexpression of a silencing-deficient SIR3 mutant led to active grouping of telomeres and specifically increased the GC efficiency between subtelomeres. Thus, physical distance limits GC at subtelomeres. However, the repair efficiency between reciprocal intrachromosomal and subtelomeric sequences varies up to 15-fold, depending on the location of the DSB, indicating that spatial proximity is not the only limiting factor for HR EXO1 deletion limited the resection at subtelomeric DSBs and improved GC efficiency.

Phosphorylated TFEB accumulated in STUB1-deficient cells and in tissues of STUB1-deficient mice resulting in reduced TFEB activity. Conversely, cellular overexpression of STUB1 resulted in reduced phosphorylated TFEB and increased TFEB activity.

28716805,"Nucleic acids are potent triggers for innate immunity. Double-stranded DNA and RNA adopt different helical conformations, including the unusual Z-conformation. Z-DNA/RNA is recognised by Z-binding domains (ZBDs), which are present in proteins implicated in antiviral immunity. These include ZBP1 (also known as DAI or DLM-1), which induces necroptosis, an inflammatory form of cell death. Using reconstitution and knock-in models, we report that mutation of key amino acids involved in Z-DNA/RNA binding in ZBP1's ZBDs prevented necroptosis upon infection with mouse cytomegalovirus. Induction of cell death was cell autonomous and required RNA synthesis but not viral DNA replication. Accordingly, ZBP1 directly bound to RNA via its ZBDs. Intact ZBP1-ZBDs were also required for necroptosis triggered by ectopic expression of ZBP1 and caspase blockade, and ZBP1 cross-linked to endogenous RNA These observations show that Z-RNA may constitute a molecular pattern that induces inflammatory cell death upon sensing by ZBP1.",Sensing of viral and endogenous RNA by ZBP1/DAI induces necroptosis.,The EMBO journal

However, the precise mechanisms involved in T helper (Th) 2 polarization by dendritic cells (DCs) are currently unclear. We have identified a previously unrecognized role for type I IFN (IFN-I) in enabling this process. An IFN-I signature was evident in DCs responding to the helminth Schistosoma mansoni or the allergen house dust mite (HDM). Further, IFN-I signaling was required for optimal DC phenotypic activation in response to helminth antigen (Ag), and efficient migration to, and localization with, T cells in the draining lymph node (dLN). Importantly, DCs generated from Ifnar1(-/-) mice were incapable of initiating Th2 responses in vivo These data demonstrate for the first time that the influence of IFN-I is not limited to antiviral or bacterial settings but also has a central role to play in DC initiation of Th2 responses.",Type I interferon is required for T helper (Th) 2 induction by dendritic cells.,The EMBO journal

Dispersed promoters are nevertheless marked by well-defined chromatin structures, suggesting that specific sequence elements must exist in these unregulated promoters. Here, we have analyzed regions of transcription initiation in the eukaryotic parasite Trypanosoma brucei, in which RNA polymerase II transcription initiation occurs over broad regions without distinct promoter motifs and lacks regulation. Using a combination of site-specific and genome-wide assays, we identified GT-rich promoters that can drive transcription and promote the targeted deposition of the histone variant H2A.Z in a genomic context-dependent manner. In addition, upon mapping nucleosome occupancy at high resolution, we find nucleosome positioning to correlate with RNA pol II enrichment and gene expression, pointing to a role in RNA maturation. Nucleosome positioning may thus represent a previously unrecognized layer of gene regulation in trypanosomes. Our findings show that even highly dispersed, unregulated promoters contain specific DNA elements that are able to induce transcription and changes in chromatin structure.",GT-rich promoters can drive RNA pol II transcription and deposition of H2A.Z in African trypanosomes.,The EMBO journal

Here, we show that SIRT1, an evolutionary conserved regulator of life span, positively affects macrophage self-renewal ability in vitro and in vivo Overexpression of SIRT1 during bone marrow-derived macrophage differentiation increased their proliferative capacity. Conversely, decrease of SIRT1 expression by shRNA inactivation, CRISPR/Cas9 mediated deletion and pharmacological inhibition restricted macrophage self-renewal in culture. Furthermore, pharmacological SIRT1 inhibition in vivo reduced steady state and cytokine-induced proliferation of alveolar and peritoneal macrophages. Mechanistically, SIRT1 inhibition negatively regulated G1/S transition, cell cycle progression and a network of self-renewal genes. This included inhibition of E2F1 and Myc and concomitant activation of FoxO1, SIRT1 targets mediating cell cycle progression and stress response, respectively. Our findings indicate that SIRT1 is a key regulator of macrophage self-renewal that integrates cell cycle and longevity pathways. This suggests that macrophage self-renewal might be a relevant parameter of ageing.",SIRT1 regulates macrophage self-renewal.,The EMBO journal
28701483,"The role of second messengers in the diversion of cellular processes by pathogens remains poorly studied despite their importance. Among these, Ca(2+) virtually regulates all known cell processes, including cytoskeletal reorganization, inflammation, or cell death pathways. Under physiological conditions, cytosolic Ca(2+) increases are transient and oscillatory, defining the so-called Ca(2+) code that links cell responses to specific Ca(2+) oscillatory patterns. During cell invasion, Shigella induces atypical local and global Ca(2+) signals. Here, we show that by hydrolyzing phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)bisphosphate, the Shigella type III effector IpgD dampens inositol-(1,4,5)trisphosphate (InsP3) levels. By modifying InsP3 dynamics and diffusion, IpgD favors the elicitation of long-lasting local Ca(2+) signals at Shigella invasion sites and converts Shigella-induced global oscillatory responses into erratic responses with atypical dynamics and amplitude. Furthermore, IpgD eventually inhibits InsP3-dependent responses during prolonged infection kinetics. IpgD thus acts as a pathogen regulator of the Ca(2+) code implicated in a versatility of cell functions. Consistent with this function, IpgD prevents the Ca(2+)-dependent activation of calpain, thereby preserving the integrity of cell adhesion structures during the early stages of infection.",The Shigella type III effector IpgD recodes Ca(2+) signals during invasion of epithelial cells.,The EMBO journal
28694245,"The synaptonemal complex (SC) is a proteinaceous macromolecular assembly that forms during meiotic prophase I and mediates adhesion of paired homologous chromosomes along their entire lengths. Although prompt disassembly of the SC during exit from prophase I is a landmark event of meiosis, the underlying mechanism regulating SC destruction has remained elusive. Here, we show that DDK (Dbf4-dependent Cdc7 kinase) is central to SC destruction. Upon exit from prophase I, Dbf4, the regulatory subunit of DDK, directly associates with and is phosphorylated by the Polo-like kinase Cdc5. In parallel, upregulated CDK1 activity also targets Dbf4. An enhanced Dbf4-Cdc5 interaction pronounced phosphorylation of Dbf4 and accelerated SC destruction, while reduced/abolished Dbf4 phosphorylation hampered destruction of SC proteins. SC destruction relieved meiotic inhibition of the ubiquitous recombinase Rad51, suggesting that the mitotic recombination machinery is reactivated following prophase I exit to repair any persisting meiotic DNA double-strand breaks. Taken together, we propose that the concerted action of DDK, Polo-like kinase, and CDK1 promotes efficient SC destruction at the end of prophase I to ensure faithful inheritance of the genome.",Fundamental cell cycle kinases collaborate to ensure timely destruction of the synaptonemal complex during meiosis.,The EMBO journal

While endothelial cells are key players in cancer progression, the influence of tumor stiffness on the endothelium and the impact on metastasis is unknown. Through quantitative mass spectrometry, we find that the matricellular protein CCN1/CYR61 is highly regulated by stiffness in endothelial cells. We show that stiffness-induced CCN1 activates beta-catenin nuclear translocation and signaling and that this contributes to upregulate N-cadherin levels on the surface of the endothelium, in vitro This facilitates N-cadherin-dependent cancer cell-endothelium interaction. Using intravital imaging, we show that knockout of Ccn1 in endothelial cells inhibits melanoma cancer cell binding to the blood vessels, a critical step in cancer cell transit through the vasculature to metastasize. Targeting stiffness-induced changes in the vasculature, such as CCN1, is therefore a potential yet unappreciated mechanism to impair metastasis.",Tumor matrix stiffness promotes metastatic cancer cell interaction with the endothelium.,The EMBO journal

In parallel, it has become clear that the spatial organization and dynamics of chromosomes can be largely explained by the statistical properties of tethered, but randomly moving, polymer chains, characterized mainly by their rigidity and compaction. How these properties of chromatin are affected during DNA damage remains, however, unclear. Here, we use live cell microscopy to track chromatin loci and measure distances between loci on yeast chromosome IV in thousands of cells, in the presence or absence of genotoxic stress. We confirm that DSBs result in enhanced chromatin subdiffusion and show that intrachromosomal distances increase with DNA damage all along the chromosome. Our data can be explained by an increase in chromatin rigidity, but not by chromatin decondensation or centromeric untethering only. We provide evidence that chromatin stiffening is mediated in part by histone H2A phosphorylation. Our results support a genome-wide stiffening of the chromatin fiber as a consequence of DNA damage and as a novel mechanism underlying increased chromatin mobility.",Chromatin stiffening underlies enhanced locus mobility after DNA damage in budding yeast.,The EMBO journal
28684539,"In Trypanosoma brucei, most mitochondrial mRNAs undergo internal changes by RNA editing and 3' end modifications. The temporally separated and functionally distinct modifications are manifested by adenylation prior to editing, and by post-editing extension of a short A-tail into a long A/U-heteropolymer. The A-tail stabilizes partially and fully edited mRNAs, while the A/U-tail enables mRNA binding to the ribosome. Here, we identify an essential pentatricopeptide repeat-containing RNA binding protein, kinetoplast polyadenylation factor 3 (KPAF3), and demonstrate its role in protecting pre-mRNA against degradation by the processome. We show that KPAF3 recruits KPAP1 poly(A) polymerase to the 3' terminus, thus leading to pre-mRNA stabilization, or decay depending on the occurrence and extent of editing. In vitro, KPAF3 stimulates KPAP1 activity and inhibits mRNA uridylation by RET1 TUTase. Our findings indicate that KPAF3 selectively directs pre-mRNA toward adenylation rather than uridylation, which is a default post-trimming modification characteristic of ribosomal and guide RNAs. As a quality control mechanism, KPAF3 binding ensures that mRNAs entering the editing pathway are adenylated and, therefore, competent for post-editing A/U-tailing and translational activation.",PPR polyadenylation factor defines mitochondrial mRNA identity and stability in trypanosomes.,The EMBO journal

This has potential repercussions for mitochondrial replacement therapy (MRT; see description of currently employed methods below) used to prevent the transmission of mtDNA-based disorders. If only a few mitochondria with defective mtDNA are left in the embryo and undergo extensive replication, it might therefore thwart the purpose of MRT In order to improve the safety and efficacy of this experimental therapy, we need a better understanding of how and which mtDNA is tagged for replication versus transcription after fertilization of the oocyte.",Mitochondrial genome inheritance and replacement in the human germline.,The EMBO journal

When HSC sense external stimuli, their adhesion status may be critical for determining HSC cell fate. The cell surface molecule, integrin alphavbeta3, is activated through HSC adhesion to extracellular matrix and niche cells. Integrin beta3 signaling maintains HSCs within the niche. Here, we showed the synergistic negative regulation of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interferon-gamma (IFNgamma) and beta3 integrin signaling in murine HSC function by a novel definitive phenotyping of HSCs. Integrin alphavbeta3 suppressed HSC function in the presence of IFNgamma and impaired integrin beta3 signaling mitigated IFNgamma-dependent negative action on HSCs. During IFNgamma stimulation, integrin beta3 signaling enhanced STAT1-mediated gene expression via serine phosphorylation. These findings show that integrin beta3 signaling intensifies the suppressive effect of IFNgamma on HSCs, which indicates that cell adhesion via integrin alphavbeta3 within the BM niche acts as a context-dependent signal modulator to regulate the HSC function under both steady-state and inflammatory conditions.",Integrin alphavbeta3 enhances the suppressive effect of interferon-gamma on hematopoietic stem cells.,The EMBO journal
28673931,"Mechanical tensions are usually generated during development at spatially defined regions within tissues. Such physical cues dictate the cellular decisions of proliferation or cell cycle arrest. Yet, the mechanisms by which mechanical stress controls the cell cycle are not yet fully understood. Here, we report that mechanical cues function upstream of Skp2 transcription in human breast cancer cells. We found that YAP, the mechano-responsive oncogenic Hippo signaling effector, directly promotes Skp2 transcription. YAP inactivation induces cell cycle exit (G0) by down-regulating Skp2, causing p21/p27 to accumulate. Both Skp2 reconstitution and p21/p27 depletion can rescue the observed defect in cell cycle progression. In the context of a tissue-mimicking 3D culture system, Skp2 inactivation effectively suppresses YAP-driven oncogenesis and aberrant stiff 3D matrix-evoked epithelial tissue behaviors. Finally, we also found that the expression of Skp2 and YAP is positively correlated in breast cancer patients. Our results not only reveal the molecular mechanism by which mechanical cues induce Skp2 transcription, but also uncover a role for YAP-Skp2 oncogenic signaling in the relationship between tissue rigidity and cancer progression.",Mechanical cue-induced YAP instructs Skp2-dependent cell cycle exit and oncogenic signaling.,The EMBO journal

Cdk enzymatic activity is tightly controlled through cyclin interactions, posttranslational modifications, and binding of inhibitors such as the p27 tumor suppressor protein. Spy1/RINGO (Spy1) proteins bind and activate Cdk but are resistant to canonical regulatory mechanisms that establish cell-cycle checkpoints. Cancer cells exploit Spy1 to stimulate proliferation through inappropriate activation of Cdks, yet the mechanism is unknown. We have determined crystal structures of the Cdk2-Spy1 and p27-Cdk2-Spy1 complexes that reveal how Spy1 activates Cdk. We find that Spy1 confers structural changes to Cdk2 that obviate the requirement of Cdk activation loop phosphorylation. Spy1 lacks the cyclin-binding site that mediates p27 and substrate affinity, explaining why Cdk-Spy1 is poorly inhibited by p27 and lacks specificity for substrates with cyclin-docking sites. We identify mutations in Spy1 that ablate its ability to activate Cdk2 and to proliferate cells.

To address this question, we investigated the global transcriptional response to perturbations in O-GlcNAcylation. Unexpectedly, many transcriptional effects of O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) inhibition were due to the activation of NRF2, the master regulator of redox stress tolerance. Moreover, we found that a signature of low OGT activity strongly correlates with NRF2 activation in multiple tumor expression datasets. Guided by this information, we identified KEAP1 (also known as KLHL19), the primary negative regulator of NRF2, as a direct substrate of OGT We show that O-GlcNAcylation of KEAP1 at serine 104 is required for the efficient ubiquitination and degradation of NRF2. Interestingly, O-GlcNAc levels and NRF2 activation co-vary in response to glucose fluctuations, indicating that KEAP1 O-GlcNAcylation links nutrient sensing to downstream stress resistance.

28659379,"Endothelial metabolism is a key regulator of angiogenesis. Glutamine metabolism in endothelial cells (ECs) has been poorly studied. We used genetic modifications and (13)C tracing approaches to define glutamine metabolism in these cells. Glutamine supplies the majority of carbons in the tricyclic acid (TCA) cycle of ECs and contributes to lipid biosynthesis via reductive carboxylation. EC-specific deletion in mice of glutaminase, the initial enzyme in glutamine catabolism, markedly blunts angiogenesis. In cell culture, glutamine deprivation or inhibition of glutaminase prevents EC proliferation, but does not prevent cell migration, which relies instead on aerobic glycolysis. Without glutamine catabolism, there is near complete loss of TCA intermediates, with no compensation from glucose-derived anaplerosis. Mechanistically, addition of exogenous alpha-ketoglutarate replenishes TCA intermediates and rescues cellular growth, but simultaneously unveils a requirement for Rac1-dependent macropinocytosis to provide non-essential amino acids, including asparagine.

Here, we show that depriving ECs of glutamine or inhibiting glutaminase 1 (GLS1) caused vessel sprouting defects due to impaired proliferation and migration, and reduced pathological ocular angiogenesis. Inhibition of glutamine metabolism in ECs did not cause energy distress, but impaired tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle anaplerosis, macromolecule production, and redox homeostasis. Only the combination of TCA cycle replenishment plus asparagine supplementation restored the metabolic aberrations and proliferation defect caused by glutamine deprivation. Mechanistically, glutamine provided nitrogen for asparagine synthesis to sustain cellular homeostasis. While ECs can take up asparagine, silencing asparagine synthetase (ASNS, which converts glutamine-derived nitrogen and aspartate to asparagine) impaired EC sprouting even in the presence of glutamine and asparagine. Asparagine further proved crucial in glutamine-deprived ECs to restore protein synthesis, suppress ER stress, and reactivate mTOR signaling.

An electron microscopy structural model of full-length ERdj3 shows that these tetramers are arranged as a dimer of dimers formed by distinct inter-subunit interactions involving ERdj3 domain II and domain III Targeted deletion of residues 175-190 within domain II renders ERdj3 a stable dimer that is folded and efficiently secreted from mammalian cells. This dimeric ERdj3 shows impaired substrate binding both in the ER and extracellular environments and reduced interactions with the ER HSP70 chaperone BiP. Furthermore, we show that overexpression of dimeric ERdj3 exacerbates ER stress-dependent reductions in the secretion of a destabilized, aggregation-prone protein and increases its accumulation as soluble oligomers in extracellular environments.

However, mRNA binding is strongly affected. Strikingly, on Ago2 mutants that cannot bind microRNAs or mRNAs, the cluster remains unphosphorylated indicating a role at late stages of gene silencing.

The essential histone variant H2A.Z affects various DNA-based processes via poorly understood mechanisms. Here, we determine the comprehensive interactome of H2A.Z and identify PWWP2A as a novel H2A.Z-nucleosome binder. PWWP2A is a functionally uncharacterized, vertebrate-specific protein that binds very tightly to chromatin through a concerted multivalent binding mode. Two internal protein regions mediate H2A.Z-specificity and nucleosome interaction, whereas the PWWP domain exhibits direct DNA binding. Genome-wide mapping reveals that PWWP2A binds selectively to H2A.Z-containing nucleosomes with strong preference for promoters of highly transcribed genes. In human cells, its depletion affects gene expression and impairs proliferation via a mitotic delay. While PWWP2A does not influence H2A.Z occupancy, the C-terminal tail of H2A.Z is one important mediator to recruit PWWP2A to chromatin. Knockdown of PWWP2A in Xenopus results in severe cranial facial defects, arising from neural crest cell differentiation and migration problems. Thus, PWWP2A is a novel H2A.Z-specific multivalent chromatin binder providing a surprising link between H2A.Z, chromosome segregation, and organ development.",Multivalent binding of PWWP2A to H2A.Z regulates mitosis and neural crest differentiation.,The EMBO journal

Amongst these, pharmacological probing identifies Ca(2+)-permeable transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 channels (TRPV1) as potent inducers of secretagogin expression through recruitment of Sp1 transcription factors. Accordingly, agonist stimulation of TRPV1s fails to rescue insulin release from pancreatic islets of glucose intolerant secretagogin knock-out((-/-)) mice. However, instead of merely impinging on the SNARE machinery, reduced insulin availability in secretagogin(-/-) mice is due to beta-cell loss, which is underpinned by the collapse of protein folding and deregulation of secretagogin-dependent USP9X deubiquitinase activity.

Strikingly, the addition of the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)-binding replication protein A (RPA) selectively restores XPF-ERCC1 endonuclease activity on this structure. The 5'-3' exonuclease SNM1A can load from the XPF-ERCC1-RPA-induced incisions and digest past the crosslink to quantitatively complete the unhooking reaction.

Here, we show that the CDK inhibitor p21 (CDKN1A) maintains the viability of DNA damage-induced senescent cells. Upon p21 knockdown, senescent cells acquired multiple DNA lesions that activated ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB kinase, leading to decreased cell survival. NF-kappaB activation induced TNF-alpha secretion and JNK activation to mediate death of senescent cells in a caspase- and JNK-dependent manner.

Here, we use FRET-based reporters to show that a global spread of ATM activity on chromatin and phosphorylation of ATM targets including KAP1 control Plk1 re-activation. These phosphorylations are rapidly counteracted by the chromatin-bound phosphatase Wip1, allowing cell cycle restart despite persistent ATM activity present at DNA lesions. Combining experimental data and mathematical modeling, we propose a model for how the minimal duration of cell cycle arrest is controlled. Our model shows how cell cycle restart can occur before completion of DNA repair and suggests a mechanism for checkpoint adaptation in human cells.",ATM/Wip1 activities at chromatin control Plk1 re-activation to determine G2 checkpoint duration.,The EMBO journal

Moreover, it has become clear that autophagy and autophagy-related processes have profound implications for human pathophysiology. However, considerable confusion persists about the use of appropriate terms to indicate specific types of autophagy and some components of the autophagy machinery, which may have detrimental effects on the expansion of the field. Driven by the overt recognition of such a potential obstacle, a panel of leading experts in the field attempts here to define several autophagy-related terms based on specific biochemical features.

Here, we report a key role for the lipid mediator lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) in decidualization, acting through its G-protein-coupled receptor LPA3 in the uterine epithelium. Knockout of Lpar3 or inhibition of the LPA-producing enzyme autotaxin (ATX) in pregnant mice leads to HB-EGF and COX-2 down-regulation near embryos and attenuates decidual reactions. Conversely, selective pharmacological activation of LPA3 induces decidualization via up-regulation of HB-EGF and COX-2. ATX and its substrate lysophosphatidylcholine can be detected in the uterine epithelium and in pre-implantation-stage embryos, respectively. Our results indicate that ATX-LPA-LPA3 signaling at the embryo-epithelial boundary induces decidualization via the canonical HB-EGF and COX-2 pathways.",Autotaxin-lysophosphatidic acid-LPA3 signaling at the embryo-epithelial boundary controls decidualization pathways.,The EMBO journal

We present novel structures of human ligands Jagged2 and Delta-like4 and human Notch2, together with functional assays, which suggest that ligand-mediated coupling of membrane recognition and Notch binding is likely to be critical in establishing the optimal context for Notch signalling. Comparisons between the Jagged and Delta family show a huge diversity in the structures of the loops at the apex of the C2 domain implicated in membrane recognition and Jagged1 missense mutations, which affect these loops and are associated with extrahepatic biliary atresia, lead to a loss of membrane recognition, but do not alter Notch binding.

Homozygous TREM2 missense mutations, such as p.T66M, lead to the FTD-like syndrome, but how they cause pathology is unknown. Using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, we generated a knock-in mouse model for the disease-associated Trem2 p.T66M mutation. Consistent with a loss-of-function mutation, we observe an intracellular accumulation of immature mutant Trem2 and reduced generation of soluble Trem2 similar to patients with the homozygous p.T66M mutation. Trem2 p.T66M knock-in mice show delayed resolution of inflammation upon in vivo lipopolysaccharide stimulation and cultured macrophages display significantly reduced phagocytic activity. Immunohistochemistry together with in vivo TSPO small animal positron emission tomography (muPET) demonstrates an age-dependent reduction in microglial activity. Surprisingly, perfusion magnetic resonance imaging and FDG-muPET imaging reveal a significant reduction in cerebral blood flow and brain glucose metabolism. Thus, we demonstrate that a TREM2 loss-of-function mutation causes brain-wide metabolic alterations pointing toward a possible function of microglia in regulating brain glucose metabolism.","The FTD-like syndrome causing TREM2 T66M mutation impairs microglia function, brain perfusion, and glucose metabolism.",The EMBO journal

Using a chemical screening exploiting PGC-like cells (PGCLCs) induced from mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), we here identify key signaling pathways critical for PGCLC proliferation. We show that the combinatorial application of Forskolin and Rolipram, which stimulate cAMP signaling via different mechanisms, expands PGCLCs up to ~50-fold in culture. The expanded PGCLCs maintain robust capacity for spermatogenesis, rescuing the fertility of infertile mice. Strikingly, during expansion, PGCLCs comprehensively erase their DNA methylome, including parental imprints, in a manner that precisely recapitulates genome-wide DNA demethylation in gonadal germ cells, while essentially maintaining their identity as sexually uncommitted PGCs, apparently through appropriate histone modifications.

Pruning dendrites are severed in their proximal regions. Prior to severing, dendritic microtubules undergo local disassembly, and dendrites thin extensively through local endocytosis. Microtubule disassembly requires a katanin homologue, but the signals initiating microtubule breakdown are not known. Here, we show that the kinase PAR-1 is required for pruning and dendritic microtubule breakdown. Our data show that neurons lacking PAR-1 fail to break down dendritic microtubules, and PAR-1 is required for an increase in neuronal microtubule dynamics at the onset of metamorphosis. Mammalian PAR-1 is a known Tau kinase, and genetic interactions suggest that PAR-1 promotes microtubule breakdown largely via inhibition of Tau also in Drosophila Finally, PAR-1 is also required for dendritic thinning, suggesting that microtubule breakdown might precede ensuing plasma membrane alterations.

We define the precise composition of the Sin3a complex in multiple cell types and identify the Fam60a subunit as a key defining feature of a variant Sin3a complex present in ES cells, which also contains Ogt and Tet1. Fam60a binds on H3K4me3-positive promoters in ES cells, together with Ogt, Tet1 and Sin3a, and is essential to maintain the complex on chromatin. Finally, we show that depletion of Fam60a phenocopies the loss of Sin3a, leading to reduced proliferation, an extended G1-phase and the deregulation of lineage genes.

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is clearly implicated in autophagosome biogenesis due to the presence of the omegasome subdomain positive for DFCP1, a phosphatidyl-inositol-3-phosphate (PI3P) binding protein. Contribution of other membrane sources, like the plasma membrane (PM), is still difficult to integrate in a global picture. Here we show that ER-plasma membrane contact sites are mobilized for autophagosome biogenesis, by direct implication of the tethering extended synaptotagmins (E-Syts) proteins. Imaging data revealed that early autophagic markers are recruited to E-Syt-containing domains during autophagy and that inhibition of E-Syts expression leads to a reduction in autophagosome biogenesis. Furthermore, we demonstrate that E-Syts are essential for autophagy-associated PI3P synthesis at the cortical ER membrane via the recruitment of VMP1, the stabilizing ER partner of the PI3KC3 complex.

Mice with conditionally deleted PIKfyve in macrophages have altered AM populations. PIKfyve deficiency results in a loss of AKT activation in response to GM-CSF, a cytokine critical for AM development. Upon exposure to house dust mite extract, mutant mice display severe lung inflammation and allergic asthma accompanied by infiltration of eosinophils and lymphoid cells.

Here we explore terminal cell fate establishment during homeostasis using the enteroendocrine cells (EEs) of the adult Drosophila midgut as a paradigm. Our data argue against the existence of local feedback signals, and we identify Numb as an intrinsic regulator of EE fate. Our data further indicate that Numb, with alpha-adaptin, acts upstream or in parallel of known regulators of EE fate to limit Notch signaling, thereby facilitating EE fate acquisition. We find that Numb is regulated in part through its asymmetric and symmetric distribution during stem cell divisions; however, its de novo synthesis is also required during the differentiation of the EE cell. Thus, this work identifies Numb as a crucial factor for cell fate choice in the adult Drosophila intestine. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate that cell-intrinsic control mechanisms of terminal cell fate acquisition can result in a balanced tissue-wide production of terminally differentiated cell types.",Intrinsic regulation of enteroendocrine fate by Numb.,The EMBO journal

We identified lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) as a new functional target of AMPKalpha1. LDH, which is a non-limiting enzyme of glycolysis in differentiated cells, was tightly regulated in stem cells. In functional experiments, LDH overexpression phenocopied AMPKalpha1(-/-) phenotype, that is shifted MuSC metabolism toward glycolysis triggering their return to quiescence, while inhibition of LDH activity rescued AMPKalpha1(-/-) MuSC self-renewal.

Post-translational modification of the proteome, such as protein phosphorylation, plays a fundamental role in the regulation of stemness and differentiation of somatic stem cells. However, it remains unclear how phosphoproteomic changes occur and contribute to epidermal differentiation. In this study, we survey the epidermal cell differentiation in a systematic manner by combining quantitative phosphoproteomics with mammalian kinome cDNA library screen. This approach identified a key signaling event, phosphorylation of a desmosome component, PKP1 (plakophilin-1) by RIPK4 (receptor-interacting serine-threonine kinase 4) during epidermal differentiation.

Processivity inhibition is proposed to be a basis of human disease, but the impacts of different levels of processivity on telomere maintenance have not been examined. Here, we delineate side chains in the telomerase active-site cavity important for repeat addition processivity, determine how they contribute to duplex and single-stranded DNA handling, and test the cellular consequences of partial or complete loss of repeat addition processivity for telomere maintenance. Biochemical findings oblige a new model for DNA and RNA handling dynamics in processive repeat synthesis. Biological analyses implicate repeat addition processivity as essential for telomerase function. However, telomeres can be maintained by telomerases with lower than wild-type processivity. Furthermore, telomerases with low processivity dramatically elongate telomeres when overexpressed.

Here, we were able to biochemically analyze autophagic intermediate membranes and show that the autophagy-initiation complex containing ULK and FIP200 first associates with the ER membrane. To further characterize the ER subdomain, we screened phospholipid biosynthetic enzymes and found that the autophagy-initiation complex localizes to phosphatidylinositol synthase (PIS)-enriched ER subdomains. Then, the initiation complex translocates to the ATG9A-positive autophagosome precursors in a PI3P-dependent manner. Depletion of phosphatidylinositol (PI) by targeting bacterial PI-specific phospholipase C to the PIS domain impairs recruitment of downstream autophagy factors and autophagosome formation.

The sphingolipid content varies among endomembranes with pre- and post-Golgi compartments being poor and rich in sphingolipids, respectively. Due to this different sphingolipid content, pre- and post-Golgi membranes serve different cellular functions. The basis for maintaining distinct subcellular sphingolipid levels in the presence of membrane trafficking and metabolic fluxes is only partially understood. Here, we describe a homeostatic regulatory circuit that controls sphingolipid levels at the trans-Golgi network (TGN). Specifically, we show that sphingomyelin production at the TGN triggers a signalling pathway leading to PtdIns(4)P dephosphorylation. Since PtdIns(4)P is required for cholesterol and sphingolipid transport to the trans-Golgi network, PtdIns(4)P consumption interrupts this transport in response to excessive sphingomyelin production. Based on this evidence, we envisage a model where this homeostatic circuit maintains a constant lipid composition in the trans-Golgi network and post-Golgi compartments, thus counteracting fluctuations in the sphingolipid biosynthetic flow.",Sphingolipid metabolic flow controls phosphoinositide turnover at the trans-Golgi network.,The EMBO journal

Although synaptic downscaling is important in neural circuit development and epilepsy, the underlying mechanisms are poorly described. We performed small RNA profiling in picrotoxin (PTX)-treated hippocampal neurons, a model of synaptic downscaling. Thereby, we identified eight microRNAs (miRNAs) that were increased in response to PTX, including miR-129-5p, whose inhibition blocked synaptic downscaling in vitro and reduced epileptic seizure severity in vivo Using transcriptome, proteome, and bioinformatic analysis, we identified the calcium pump Atp2b4 and doublecortin (Dcx) as miR-129-5p targets. Restoring Atp2b4 and Dcx expression was sufficient to prevent synaptic downscaling in PTX-treated neurons. Furthermore, we characterized a functional crosstalk between miR-129-5p and the RNA-binding protein (RBP) Rbfox1. In the absence of PTX, Rbfox1 promoted the expression of Atp2b4 and Dcx. Upon PTX treatment, Rbfox1 expression was downregulated by miR-129-5p, thereby allowing the repression of Atp2b4 and Dcx. We therefore identified a novel activity-dependent miRNA/RBP crosstalk during synaptic scaling, with potential implications for neural network homeostasis and epileptogenesis.",A microRNA-129-5p/Rbfox crosstalk coordinates homeostatic downscaling of excitatory synapses.,The EMBO journal

We found that PumA is essential for virulence and inhibits NF-kappaB, a property transferable to non-PumA strain PA14, suggesting no additional factors are needed for PumA function. The TIR domain is able to interact with the Toll-like receptor (TLR) adaptors TIRAP and MyD88, as well as the ubiquitin-associated protein 1 (UBAP1), a component of the endosomal-sorting complex required for transport I (ESCRT-I). These interactions are not spatially exclusive as we show UBAP1 can associate with MyD88, enhancing its plasma membrane localization.

Cohesin removal via mitotic kinases and Wapl has to be prevented in pericentromeric regions in order to protect cohesion until metaphase, but the mechanisms of mitotic cohesion protection remain elusive in Drosophila Here, we show that dalmatian (Dmt), an ortholog of the vertebrate cohesin-associated protein sororin, is required for protection of mitotic cohesion in flies. Dmt is essential for cohesion establishment during interphase and is enriched on pericentromeric heterochromatin. Dmt is recruited through direct association with heterochromatin protein-1 (HP1), and this interaction is required for cohesion. During mitosis, Dmt interdependently recruits protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) to pericentromeric regions, and PP2A binding is required for Dmt to protect cohesion. Intriguingly, Dmt is sufficient to protect cohesion upon heterologous expression in human cells.

Here, we have characterized a ternary complex between syntaxin1, SNAP25, and the SM protein Munc18-1 as a possible acceptor complex for the R-SNARE synaptobrevin. The ternary complex binds synaptobrevin with fast kinetics, resulting in the rapid formation of a fully zippered SNARE complex to which Munc18-1 remains tethered by the N-terminal domain of syntaxin1. Intriguingly, only one of the synaptobrevin truncation mutants (Syb1-65) was able to bind to the syntaxin1:SNAP25:Munc18-1 complex, suggesting either a cooperative zippering mechanism that proceeds bidirectionally or the progressive R-SNARE binding via an SM template.

Innate immunity controls ZIKV infection and disease in most infected patients through mechanisms that remain to be understood. Here, we studied the morphological cellular changes induced by ZIKV and addressed the role of interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITM), a family of broad-spectrum antiviral factors, during viral replication. We report that ZIKV induces massive vacuolization followed by ""implosive"" cell death in human epithelial cells, primary skin fibroblasts and astrocytes, a phenomenon which is exacerbated when IFITM3 levels are low. It is reminiscent of paraptosis, a caspase-independent, non-apoptotic form of cell death associated with the formation of large cytoplasmic vacuoles.

In Escherichia coli, dimerization of 70S ribosomes into 100S requires the action of the ribosome modulation factor (RMF) and the hibernation-promoting factor (HPF). Most other bacteria lack RMF and instead contain a long form HPF (LHPF), which is necessary and sufficient for 100S formation. While some structural information exists as to how RMF and HPF mediate formation of E. coli 100S (Ec100S), structural insight into 100S formation by LHPF has so far been lacking.

28468752,"SMAD4 is a common intracellular effector for TGF-beta family cytokines, but the mechanism by which its activity is dynamically regulated is unclear. We demonstrated that ubiquitin-specific protease (USP) 4 strongly induces activin/BMP signaling by removing the inhibitory monoubiquitination from SMAD4. This modification was triggered by the recruitment of the E3 ligase, SMURF2, to SMAD4 following ligand-induced regulatory (R)-SMAD-SMAD4 complex formation. Whereas the interaction of the negative regulator c-SKI inhibits SMAD4 monoubiquitination, the ligand stimulates the recruitment of SMURF2 to the c-SKI-SMAD2 complex and triggers c-SKI ubiquitination and degradation. Thus, SMURF2 has a role in termination and initiation of TGF-beta family signaling. An increase in monoubiquitinated SMAD4 in USP4-depleted mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) decreased both the BMP- and activin-induced changes in the embryonic stem cell fate. USP4 sustained SMAD4 activity during activin- and BMP-mediated morphogenic events in early zebrafish embryos. Moreover, zebrafish depleted of USP4 exhibited defective cell migration and slower coordinated cell movement known as epiboly, both of which could be rescued by SMAD4.

Here, we show that embryogenesis-associated mouse RGC differentiation depends on mitophagy, the programmed autophagic clearance of mitochondria. The elimination of mitochondria during RGC differentiation was coupled to a metabolic shift with increased lactate production and elevated expression of glycolytic enzymes at the mRNA level. Pharmacological and genetic inhibition of either mitophagy or glycolysis consistently inhibited RGC differentiation. Local hypoxia triggered expression of the mitophagy regulator BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19-kDa-interacting protein 3-like (BNIP3L, best known as NIX) at peak RGC differentiation. Retinas from NIX-deficient mice displayed increased mitochondrial mass, reduced expression of glycolytic enzymes and decreased neuronal differentiation. Similarly, we provide evidence that NIX-dependent mitophagy contributes to mitochondrial elimination during macrophage polarization towards the proinflammatory and more glycolytic M1 phenotype, but not to M2 macrophage differentiation, which primarily relies on oxidative phosphorylation. In summary, developmentally controlled mitophagy promotes a metabolic switch towards glycolysis, which in turn contributes to cellular differentiation in several distinct developmental contexts.",Programmed mitophagy is essential for the glycolytic switch during cell differentiation.,The EMBO journal
28446510,"Lysosome-mediated autophagy is essential for cellular survival and homeostasis upon nutrient deprivation, but is repressed after feeding. Despite the emerging importance of transcriptional regulation of autophagy by nutrient-sensing factors, the role for epigenetic control is largely unexplored. Here, we show that Small Heterodimer Partner (SHP) mediates postprandial epigenetic repression of hepatic autophagy by recruiting histone demethylase LSD1 in response to a late fed-state hormone, FGF19 (hFGF19, mFGF15). FGF19 treatment or feeding inhibits macroautophagy, including lipophagy, but these effects are blunted in SHP-null mice or LSD1-depleted mice. In addition, feeding-mediated autophagy inhibition is attenuated in FGF15-null mice. Upon FGF19 treatment or feeding, SHP recruits LSD1 to CREB-bound autophagy genes, including Tfeb, resulting in dissociation of CRTC2, LSD1-mediated demethylation of gene-activation histone marks H3K4-me2/3, and subsequent accumulation of repressive histone modifications. Both FXR and SHP inhibit hepatic autophagy interdependently, but while FXR acts early, SHP acts relatively late after feeding, which effectively sustains postprandial inhibition of autophagy. This study demonstrates that the FGF19-SHP-LSD1 axis maintains homeostasis by suppressing unnecessary autophagic breakdown of cellular components, including lipids, under nutrient-rich postprandial conditions.",A postprandial FGF19-SHP-LSD1 regulatory axis mediates epigenetic repression of hepatic autophagy.,The EMBO journal

Sister chromatid cohesion requires an acetyl-transferase (Eso1 in fission yeast) counteracting Wpl1, promoting cohesin release from DNA We report here that Wpl1 anti-cohesion function includes an additional mechanism. A genetic screen uncovered that Protein Phosphatase 4 (PP4) mutants allowed cell survival in the complete absence of Eso1. PP4 co-immunoprecipitated Wpl1 and cohesin and Wpl1 triggered Rad21 de-phosphorylation in a PP4-dependent manner. Relevant residues were identified and mapped within the central domain of Rad21. Phospho-mimicking alleles dampened Wpl1 anti-cohesion activity, while alanine mutants were neutral indicating that Rad21 phosphorylation would shelter cohesin from Wpl1 unless erased by PP4. Experiments in post-replicative cells lacking Eso1 revealed two cohesin populations. Type 1 was released from DNA by Wpl1 in a PP4-independent manner. Type 2 cohesin, however, remained DNA-bound and lost its cohesiveness in a manner depending on Wpl1- and PP4-mediated Rad21 de-phosphorylation.

It forms filaments under the cytoplasmic membrane at the division site where, together with other proteins it recruits, it drives peptidoglycan synthesis and constricts the cell. Despite extensive study, the arrangement of FtsZ filaments and their role in division continue to be debated. Here, we apply electron cryotomography to image the native structure of intact dividing cells and show that constriction in a variety of Gram-negative bacterial cells, including Proteus mirabilis and Caulobacter crescentus, initiates asymmetrically, accompanied by asymmetric peptidoglycan incorporation and short FtsZ-like filament formation. These results show that a complete ring of FtsZ is not required for constriction and lead us to propose a model for FtsZ-driven division in which short dynamic FtsZ filaments can drive initial peptidoglycan synthesis and envelope constriction at the onset of cytokinesis, later increasing in length and number to encircle the division plane and complete constriction.",Short FtsZ filaments can drive asymmetric cell envelope constriction at the onset of bacterial cytokinesis.,The EMBO journal

Here, the pennate diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum was studied at the metabolite and transcriptome level during nitrogen starvation and following imposition of three other stresses that impede growth. The coordinated upregulation of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle during the nitrogen stress response was the most striking observation. Through co-expression analysis and DNA binding assays, the transcription factor bZIP14 was identified as a regulator of the TCA cycle, also beyond the nitrogen starvation response, namely in diurnal regulation. Accordingly, metabolic and transcriptional shifts were observed upon overexpression of bZIP14 in transformed P. tricornutum cells. Our data indicate that the TCA cycle is a tightly regulated and important hub for carbon reallocation in the diatom cell during nutrient starvation and that bZIP14 is a conserved regulator of this cycle.",The transcription factor bZIP14 regulates the TCA cycle in the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum.,The EMBO journal
28420743,"Biochemistry textbooks and cell culture experiments seem to be telling us two different things about the significance of external glutamine supply for mammalian cell growth and proliferation. Despite the fact that glutamine is a nonessential amino acid that can be synthesized by cells from glucose-derived carbons and amino acid-derived ammonia, most mammalian cells in tissue culture cannot proliferate or even survive in an environment that does not contain millimolar levels of glutamine. Not only are the levels of glutamine in standard tissue culture media at least ten-fold higher than other amino acids, but glutamine is also the most abundant amino acid in the human bloodstream, where it is assiduously maintained at approximately 0.5 mM through a combination of dietary uptake, de novo synthesis, and muscle protein catabolism. The complex metabolic logic of the proliferating cancer cells' appetite for glutamine-which goes far beyond satisfying their protein synthesis requirements-has only recently come into focus. In this review, we examine the diversity of biosynthetic and regulatory uses of glutamine and their role in proliferation, stress resistance, and cellular identity, as well as discuss the mechanisms that cells utilize in order to adapt to glutamine limitation.","Cancer cell metabolism: the essential role of the nonessential amino acid, glutamine.",The EMBO journal

Here, we identified the ~90 kDa helicase core of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sen1 as sufficient for transcription termination in vitro and determined the corresponding structure at 1.8 A resolution. In addition to the catalytic and auxiliary subdomains characteristic of the SF1B family, Sen1 has a distinct and evolutionarily conserved structural feature that ""braces"" the helicase core. Comparative structural analyses indicate that the ""brace"" is essential in shaping a favorable conformation for RNA binding and unwinding. We also show that subdomain 1C (the ""prong"") is an essential element for 5'-3' unwinding and for Sen1-mediated transcription termination in vitro Finally, yeast Sen1 mutant proteins mimicking the disease forms of the human orthologue, senataxin, show lower capacity of RNA unwinding and impairment of transcription termination in vitro The combined biochemical and structural data thus provide a molecular model for the specificity of Sen1 in transcription termination and more generally for the unwinding mechanism of 5'-3' helicases.",Sen1 has unique structural features grafted on the architecture of the Upf1-like helicase family.,The EMBO journal

PRDM16 is a transcription factor that activates brown fat-specific genes while repressing white fat and muscle-specific genes in adipocytes. Whether PRDM16 also controls other gene programs to regulate adipocyte function was unclear. Here, we identify a novel role for PRDM16 in suppressing type I interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes (ISGs), including Stat1, in adipocytes in vitro and in vivo Ectopic activation of type I IFN signaling in brown adipocytes induces mitochondrial dysfunction and reduces uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) expression. Prdm16-deficient adipose displays an exaggerated response to type I IFN, including higher STAT1 levels and reduced mitochondrial gene expression. Mechanistically, PRDM16 represses ISGs through binding to promoter regions of these genes and blocking the activating function of IFN regulatory factor 1 (IRF1).

28408437,"Deregulated expression of MYC enhances glutamine utilization and renders cell survival dependent on glutamine, inducing ""glutamine addiction"". Surprisingly, colon cancer cells that express high levels of MYC due to WNT pathway mutations are not glutamine-addicted but undergo a reversible cell cycle arrest upon glutamine deprivation. We show here that glutamine deprivation suppresses translation of endogenous MYC via the 3'-UTR of the MYC mRNA, enabling escape from apoptosis. This regulation is mediated by glutamine-dependent changes in adenosine-nucleotide levels. Glutamine deprivation causes a global reduction in promoter association of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) and slows transcriptional elongation. While activation of MYC restores binding of MYC and RNAPII function on most promoters, restoration of elongation is imperfect and activation of MYC in the absence of glutamine causes stalling of RNAPII on multiple genes, correlating with R-loop formation. Stalling of RNAPII and R-loop formation can cause DNA damage, arguing that the MYC 3'-UTR is critical for maintaining genome stability when ribonucleotide levels are low.",The MYC mRNA 3'-UTR couples RNA polymerase II function to glutamine and ribonucleotide levels.,The EMBO journal

Here, we report an improved RNA extraction method: extensive needle shearing or heating of cell lysate in RNA extraction reagent improved NEAT1_2 extraction by 20-fold (a property we term ""semi-extractability""), whereas using a conventional method NEAT1_2 was trapped in the protein phase. The improved extraction method enabled us to estimate that approximately 50 NEAT1_2 molecules are present in a single paraspeckle. Another architectural lncRNA, IGS16, also exhibited similar semi-extractability. A comparison of RNA-seq data from needle-sheared and control samples revealed the existence of multiple semi-extractable RNAs, many of which were localized in subnuclear granule-like structures. The semi-extractability of NEAT1_2 correlated with its association with paraspeckle proteins and required the prion-like domain of the RNA-binding protein FUS This observation suggests that tenacious RNA-protein and protein-protein interactions, which drive nuclear body formation, are responsible for semi-extractability.

How this protein, at the crossroad between sterol uptake and synthesis pathways, impacts the intracellular distribution of this lipid was ill-defined. Here, by using in situ cholesterol labeling and quantification, we demonstrated that STARD3 induces cholesterol accumulation in endosomes at the expense of the plasma membrane. STARD3-mediated cholesterol routing depends both on its lipid transfer activity and its ability to create ER-endosome contacts. Corroborating this, in vitro reconstitution assays indicated that STARD3 and its ER-anchored partner, Vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein (VAP), assemble into a machine that allows a highly efficient transport of cholesterol within membrane contacts. Thus, STARD3 is a cholesterol transporter scaffolding ER-endosome contacts and modulating cellular cholesterol repartition by delivering cholesterol to endosomes.",STARD3 mediates endoplasmic reticulum-to-endosome cholesterol transport at membrane contact sites.,The EMBO journal

While accumulating studies are focused on the roles of glucose and amino acid metabolism in facilitating pluripotency, little is known regarding the role of lipid metabolism in regulation of stem cell activities. Here, we show that fatty acid (FA) synthesis activation is critical for stem cell pluripotency. Our initial observations demonstrated enhanced lipogenesis in pluripotent cells and during cellular reprogramming. Further analysis indicated that de novo FA synthesis controls cellular reprogramming and embryonic stem cell pluripotency through mitochondrial fission. Mechanistically, we found that de novo FA synthesis regulated by the lipogenic enzyme ACC1 leads to the enhanced mitochondrial fission via (i) consumption of AcCoA which affects acetylation-mediated FIS1 ubiquitin-proteasome degradation and (ii) generation of lipid products that drive the mitochondrial dynamic equilibrium toward fission. Moreover, we demonstrated that the effect of Acc1 on cellular reprogramming via mitochondrial fission also exists in human iPSC induction.

Aberrant forms of SGs have been implicated in age-related diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but the molecular events triggering their formation are still unknown. Here, we find that misfolded proteins, such as ALS-linked variants of SOD1, specifically accumulate and aggregate within SGs in human cells. This decreases the dynamics of SGs, changes SG composition, and triggers an aberrant liquid-to-solid transition of in vitro reconstituted compartments. We show that chaperone recruitment prevents the formation of aberrant SGs and promotes SG disassembly when the stress subsides. Moreover, we identify a backup system for SG clearance, which involves transport of aberrant SGs to the aggresome and their degradation by autophagy. Thus, cells employ a system of SG quality control to prevent accumulation of misfolded proteins and maintain the dynamic state of SGs, which may have relevance for ALS and related diseases.",An aberrant phase transition of stress granules triggered by misfolded protein and prevented by chaperone function.,The EMBO journal

Using Argonaute2 immunoprecipitation, we performed global profiling of miRNAs in adult-born OB neurons and identified let-7 as a highly abundant miRNA family. Knockdown of let-7 in migrating neuroblasts prevented radial migration and led to an immature morphology of newly formed interneurons. This phenotype was accompanied by a decrease in autophagic activity. Overexpression of Beclin-1 or TFEB in new-born neurons lacking let-7 resulted in re-activation of autophagy and restored radial migration.

We show that the presynaptic lipid phosphatase synaptojanin is required for macroautophagy, and this role is inhibited by the Parkinson's disease mutation R258Q. Synaptojanin drives synaptic endocytosis by dephosphorylating PI(4,5)P2, but this function appears normal in Synaptojanin(RQ) knock-in flies. Instead, R258Q affects the synaptojanin SAC1 domain that dephosphorylates PI(3)P and PI(3,5)P2, two lipids found in autophagosomal membranes. Using advanced imaging, we show that Synaptojanin(RQ) mutants accumulate the PI(3)P/PI(3,5)P2-binding protein Atg18a on nascent synaptic autophagosomes, blocking autophagosome maturation at fly synapses and in neurites of human patient induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons. Additionally, we observe neurodegeneration, including dopaminergic neuron loss, in Synaptojanin(RQ) flies.

Here, we show that monocytes adapted to 3% O2 show greater susceptibility to antibody-dependent enhancement of DENV infection. Low oxygen level induces HIF1alpha-dependent upregulation of fragment crystallizable gamma receptor IIA (FcgammaRIIA) as well as HIF1alpha-independent alterations in membrane ether lipid concentrations. The increased FcgammaRIIA expression operates synergistically with altered membrane composition, possibly through increase membrane fluidity, to increase uptake of DENV immune complexes for enhanced infection.

Clearing and subsequent 3D reconstruction of entire organoids reveal that many of these regions are interconnected, suggesting that the entire range of dorso-ventral identities can be generated within continuous neuroepithelia. Consistent with this, we demonstrate the presence of forebrain organizing centers that express secreted growth factors, which may be involved in dorso-ventral patterning within organoids. Furthermore, we demonstrate the timed generation of neurons with mature morphologies, as well as the subsequent generation of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Our work provides the methodology and quality criteria for phenotypic analysis of brain organoids and shows that the spatial and temporal patterning events governing human brain development can be recapitulated in vitro.",Self-organized developmental patterning and differentiation in cerebral organoids.,The EMBO journal
28283581,"The axon initial segment (AIS) is a specialized domain essential for neuronal function, the formation of which begins with localization of an ankyrin-G (AnkG) scaffold. However, the mechanism directing and maintaining AnkG localization is largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that in vivo knockdown of microtubule cross-linking factor 1 (MTCL1) in cerebellar Purkinje cells causes loss of axonal polarity coupled with AnkG mislocalization. MTCL1 lacking MT-stabilizing activity failed to restore these defects, and stable MT bundles spanning the AIS were disorganized in knockdown cells. Interestingly, during early postnatal development, colocalization of MTCL1 with these stable MT bundles was observed prominently in the axon hillock and proximal axon. These results indicate that MTCL1-mediated formation of stable MT bundles is crucial for maintenance of AnkG localization. We also demonstrate that Mtcl1 gene disruption results in abnormal motor coordination with Purkinje cell degeneration, and provide evidence suggesting possible involvement of MTCL1 dysfunction in the pathogenesis of spinocerebellar ataxia.",MTCL1 plays an essential role in maintaining Purkinje neuron axon initial segment.,The EMBO journal
28283580,"Glioblastoma is a highly heterogeneous aggressive primary brain tumor, with the glioma stem-like cells (GSC) being more sensitive to cytotoxic lymphocyte-mediated killing than glioma differentiated cells (GDC). However, the mechanism behind this higher sensitivity is unclear. Here, we found that the mitochondrial morphology of GSCs modulates the ER-mitochondria contacts that regulate the surface expression of sialylated glycans and their recognition by cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells. GSCs displayed diminished ER-mitochondria contacts compared to GDCs. Forced ER-mitochondria contacts in GSCs increased their cell surface expression of sialylated glycans and reduced their susceptibility to cytotoxic lymphocytes. Therefore, mitochondrial morphology and dynamism dictate the ER-mitochondria contacts in order to regulate the surface expression of certain glycans and thus play a role in GSC recognition and elimination by immune effector cells. Targeting the mitochondrial morphology, dynamism, and contacts with the ER could be an innovative strategy to deplete the cancer stem cell compartment to successfully treat glioblastoma.",ER-mitochondria contacts control surface glycan expression and sensitivity to killer lymphocytes in glioma stem-like cells.,The EMBO journal

Here, we show that HSP-60/HSPD1, a major mitochondrial chaperone, boosts anti-bacterial immunity through the up-regulation of p38 MAP kinase signaling. We first identify 16 evolutionarily conserved mitochondrial components that affect the immunity of Caenorhabditis elegans against pathogenic Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA14). Among them, the mitochondrial chaperone HSP-60 is necessary and sufficient to increase resistance to PA14. We show that HSP-60 in the intestine and neurons is crucial for the resistance to PA14. We then find that p38 MAP kinase signaling, an evolutionarily conserved anti-bacterial immune pathway, is down-regulated by genetic inhibition of hsp-60, and up-regulated by increased expression of hsp-60 Overexpression of HSPD1, the mammalian ortholog of hsp-60, increases p38 MAP kinase activity in human cells, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved mechanism. Further, cytosol-localized HSP-60 physically binds and stabilizes SEK-1/MAP kinase kinase 3, which in turn up-regulates p38 MAP kinase and increases immunity.

28279977,"Nuclear FOXO proteins act as tumor suppressors by transcriptionally activating genes involved in apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, and these anticancer functions are inhibited by AKT-induced phosphorylation and cytoplasmic sequestration of FOXOs. We found that, after AKT-mediated phosphorylation at serine 319, FOXO1 binds to IQGAP1, a hub for activation of the MAPK pathway, and impedes IQGAP1-dependent phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (pERK1/2). Conversely, decreased FOXO1 expression increases pERK1/2 in cancer cell lines and correlates with increased pERK1/2 levels in patient specimens and disease progression. Treatment of cancer cells with PI3K inhibitors or taxane causes FOXO1 localization in the nucleus, increased expression of pERK1/2, and drug resistance. These effects are reversed by administering a small FOXO1-derived phospho-mimicking peptide inhibitor in vitro and in mice. Our results show a tumor suppressor role of AKT-phosphorylated FOXO1 in the cytoplasm and suggest that this function of FOXO1 can be harnessed to overcome chemoresistance in cancer.",AKT-phosphorylated FOXO1 suppresses ERK activation and chemoresistance by disrupting IQGAP1-MAPK interaction.,The EMBO journal

Here, we report that lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) upregulates hypoxia responses by demethylating RACK1 protein, a component of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) ubiquitination machinery, and consequently suppressing the oxygen-independent degradation of HIF-1alpha. This ability of LSD1 is attenuated during prolonged hypoxia, with a decrease in the cellular level of flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), a metabolic cofactor of LSD1, causing HIF-1alpha downregulation in later stages of hypoxia. Exogenously provided FAD restores HIF-1alpha stability, indicating a rate-limiting role for FAD in LSD1-mediated HIF-1alpha regulation. Transcriptomic analyses of patient tissues show that the HIF-1 signature is highly correlated with the expression of LSD1 target genes as well as the enzymes of FAD biosynthetic pathway in triple-negative breast cancers, reflecting the significance of FAD-dependent LSD1 activity in cancer progression.

Here, we report that the deubiquitylation enzyme (DUB) ataxin-3 counteracts RNF4 activity during the DNA double-strand break (DSB) response. We find that ataxin-3 negatively regulates ubiquitylation of the checkpoint mediator MDC1, a known RNF4 substrate. Loss of ataxin-3 markedly decreases the chromatin dwell time of MDC1 at DSBs, which can be fully reversed by co-depletion of RNF4. Ataxin-3 is recruited to DSBs in a SUMOylation-dependent fashion, and in vitro it directly interacts with and is stimulated by recombinant SUMO, defining a SUMO-dependent mechanism for DUB activity toward MDC1. Loss of ataxin-3 results in reduced DNA damage-induced ubiquitylation due to impaired MDC1-dependent recruitment of the ubiquitin ligases RNF8 and RNF168, and reduced recruitment of 53BP1 and BRCA1. Finally, ataxin-3 is required for efficient MDC1-dependent DSB repair by non-homologous end-joining and homologous recombination. Consequently, loss of ataxin-3 sensitizes cells to ionizing radiation and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor. We propose that the opposing activities of RNF4 and ataxin-3 consolidate robust MDC1-dependent signaling and repair of DSBs.",Ataxin-3 consolidates the MDC1-dependent DNA double-strand break response by counteracting the SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligase RNF4.,The EMBO journal
28270524,"Seasonal reproduction in many organisms requires detection of day length. This is achieved by integrating information on the light environment with an internal photoperiodic time-keeping mechanism. Arabidopsis thaliana promotes flowering in response to long days (LDs), and CONSTANS (CO) transcription factor represents a photoperiodic timer whose stability is higher when plants are exposed to light under LDs. Here, we show that PSEUDO RESPONSE REGULATOR (PRR) proteins directly mediate this stabilization. PRRs interact with and stabilize CO at specific times during the day, thereby mediating its accumulation under LDs. PRR-mediated stabilization increases binding of CO to the promoter of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), leading to enhanced FT transcription and early flowering under these conditions. PRRs were previously reported to contribute to timekeeping by regulating CO transcription through their roles in the circadian clock. We propose an additional role for PRRs in which they act upon CO protein to promote flowering, directly coupling information on light exposure to the timekeeper and allowing recognition of LDs.",PSEUDO RESPONSE REGULATORs stabilize CONSTANS protein to promote flowering in response to day length.,The EMBO journal

We describe here a novel FP deficiency (E244K) caused by a single point mutation which results in a very low level of AP activity. Recombinant FP E244K is monomeric, fails to support bacteriolysis, and binds weakly to C3 products. We compare this to a monomeric unit excised from oligomeric FP, which is also dysfunctional in bacteriolysis but binds the AP proconvertase, C3 convertase, C3 products and partially stabilizes the convertase. The crystal structure of such a FP-convertase complex suggests that the major contact between FP and the AP convertase is mediated by a single FP thrombospondin repeat and a small region in C3b. Small angle X-ray scattering indicates that FP E244K is trapped in a compact conformation preventing its oligomerization.

Here, we show that LUBAC forms part of the TRAIL-R-associated complex I as well as of the cytoplasmic TRAIL-induced complex II In both of these complexes, HOIP limits caspase-8 activity and, consequently, apoptosis whilst being itself cleaved in a caspase-8-dependent manner. Yet, by limiting the formation of a RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL-containing complex, LUBAC also restricts TRAIL-induced necroptosis. We identify RIPK1 and caspase-8 as linearly ubiquitinated targets of LUBAC following TRAIL stimulation. Contrary to its role in preventing TRAIL-induced RIPK1-independent apoptosis, HOIP presence, but not its activity, is required for preventing necroptosis. By promoting recruitment of the IKK complex to complex I, LUBAC also promotes TRAIL-induced activation of NF-kappaB and, consequently, the production of cytokines, downstream of FADD, caspase-8 and cIAP1/2. Hence, LUBAC controls the TRAIL signalling outcome from complex I and II, two platforms which both trigger cell death and gene activation.",The linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex regulates TRAIL-induced gene activation and cell death.,The EMBO journal

We demonstrate that this notion is not a general principle of neuronal development by documenting the timing of mitosis in relation to multiple differentiation events for bipolar cells (BCs) in the zebrafish retina using in vivo imaging. We found that BC progenitors undergo terminal neurogenic divisions while in markedly disparate stages of neuronal differentiation. Remarkably, the differentiation state of individual BC progenitors at mitosis is not arbitrary but matches the differentiation state of post-mitotic BCs in their surround. By experimentally shifting the relative timing of progenitor division and differentiation, we provide evidence that neurogenesis and differentiation can occur independently of each other. We propose that the uncoupling of neurogenesis and differentiation could provide neurogenic programs with flexibility, while allowing for synchronous neuronal development within a continuously expanding cell pool.",Uncoupling of neurogenesis and differentiation during retinal development.,The EMBO journal

Here, we demonstrate that the human 7SK snRNP also functions as a canonical transcription factor that, in collaboration with the little elongation complex (LEC) comprising ELL, Ice1, Ice2, and ZC3H8, promotes transcription of RNAPII-specific spliceosomal snRNA and small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) genes. The 7SK snRNA specifically associates with a fraction of RNAPII hyperphosphorylated at Ser5 and Ser7, which is a hallmark of RNAPII engaged in snRNA synthesis. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and chromatin isolation by RNA purification (ChIRP) experiments revealed enrichments for all components of the 7SK snRNP on RNAPII-specific sn/snoRNA genes. Depletion of 7SK snRNA or Larp7 disrupts LEC integrity, inhibits RNAPII recruitment to RNAPII-specific sn/snoRNA genes, and reduces nascent snRNA and snoRNA synthesis.

28254837,"Upon aging, hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) undergo changes in function and structure, including skewing to myeloid lineages, lower reconstitution potential and loss of protein polarity. While stem cell intrinsic mechanisms are known to contribute to HSC aging, little is known on whether age-related changes in the bone marrow niche regulate HSC aging. Upon aging, the expression of osteopontin (OPN) in the murine bone marrow stroma is reduced. Exposure of young HSCs to an OPN knockout niche results in a decrease in engraftment, an increase in long-term HSC frequency and loss of stem cell polarity. Exposure of aged HSCs to thrombin-cleaved OPN attenuates aging of old HSCs, resulting in increased engraftment, decreased HSC frequency, increased stem cell polarity and a restored balance of lymphoid and myeloid cells in peripheral blood.

Opposing earlier gating hypotheses and electrophysiology reports, quantification of total uptake by radiolabeled substrate indicates a permanently open conformation of the bacterial formate transporter, FocA, irrespective of the pH Site-directed mutagenesis, heavy water effects, mathematical modeling, and simulations of solvation imply a general, proton motive force-driven FNT transport mechanism: Electrostatic attraction of the acid anion into a hydrophobic vestibule decreases substrate acidity and facilitates protonation by the bulk solvent.

Here, we report that the small GTPase ROP2, if activated by the phytohormone auxin, promotes activation of TOR, and thus translation reinitiation of uORF-containing mRNAs. Plants with high levels of active ROP2, including those expressing constitutively active ROP2 (CA-ROP2), contain high levels of active TOR ROP2 physically interacts with and, when GTP-bound, activates TOR in vitro TOR activation in response to auxin is abolished in ROP-deficient rop2 rop6 ROP4 RNAi plants. GFP-TOR can associate with endosome-like structures in ROP2-overexpressing plants, indicating that endosomes mediate ROP2 effects on TOR activation. CA-ROP2 is efficient in loading uORF-containing mRNAs onto polysomes and stimulates translation in protoplasts, and both processes are sensitive to TOR inhibitor AZD-8055. TOR inactivation abolishes ROP2 regulation of translation reinitiation, but not its effects on cytoskeleton or intracellular trafficking.

However, the impact of S6 kinase activity on cellular senescence remains to be established. Here, we show that the constitutive activation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) by tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) mutations induces a premature senescence programme in fibroblasts that relies on S6 kinases. To determine novel molecular targets linking S6 kinase activation to the control of senescence, we set up a chemical genetic screen, leading to the identification of the nuclear epigenetic factor ZRF1 (also known as DNAJC2, MIDA1, Mpp11). S6 kinases phosphorylate ZRF1 on Ser47 in cultured cells and in mammalian tissues in vivo Knock-down of ZRF1 or expression of a phosphorylation mutant is sufficient to blunt the S6 kinase-dependent senescence programme. This is traced by a sharp alteration in p16 levels, the cell cycle inhibitor and a master regulator of senescence.

28228439,"Gynogenesis is an asexual mode of reproduction common to animals and plants, in which stimuli from the sperm cell trigger the development of the unfertilized egg cell into a haploid embryo. Fine mapping restricted a major maize QTL (quantitative trait locus) responsible for the aptitude of inducer lines to trigger gynogenesis to a zone containing a single gene NOT LIKE DAD (NLD) coding for a patatin-like phospholipase A. In all surveyed inducer lines, NLD carries a 4-bp insertion leading to a predicted truncated protein. This frameshift mutation is responsible for haploid induction because complementation with wild-type NLD abolishes the haploid induction capacity. Activity of the NLD promoter is restricted to mature pollen and pollen tube. The translational NLD::citrine fusion protein likely localizes to the sperm cell plasma membrane. In Arabidopsis roots, the truncated protein is no longer localized to the plasma membrane, contrary to the wild-type NLD protein.

Substrate solubilization requires disruption of sHsp association with trapped misfolded proteins. Here, we unravel a specific interplay between Hsp70 and sHsps at the initial step of the solubilization process. We show that Hsp70 displaces surface-bound sHsps from sHsp-substrate assemblies. This Hsp70 activity is unique among chaperones and highly sensitive to alterations in Hsp70 concentrations. The Hsp70 activity is reflected in the organization of sHsp-substrate assemblies, including an outer dynamic sHsp shell that is removed by Hsp70 and a stable core comprised mainly of aggregated substrates. Binding of Hsp70 to the sHsp/substrate core protects the core from aggregation and directs sequestered substrates towards refolding pathway.

Although the sensing of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca(2+) stores by STIM proteins and coupling to Orai1 channels is well understood, how mitochondria communicate with Orai1 channels to regulate SOCE activation remains elusive. Here, we reveal that SOCE is accompanied by a rise in cytosolic Na(+) that is critical in activating the mitochondrial Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger (NCLX) causing enhanced mitochondrial Na(+) uptake and Ca(2+) efflux. Omission of extracellular Na(+) prevents the cytosolic Na(+) rise, inhibits NCLX activity, and impairs SOCE and Orai1 channel current. We show further that SOCE activates a mitochondrial redox transient which is dependent on NCLX and is required for preventing Orai1 inactivation through oxidation of a critical cysteine (Cys195) in the third transmembrane helix of Orai1. We show that mitochondrial targeting of catalase is sufficient to rescue redox transients, SOCE, and Orai1 currents in NCLX-deficient cells.

We find that a central domain of Nmd3 mimics the translation elongation factor eIF5A, inserting into the E site of the ribosome and pulling the L1 stalk into a closed position. Additional domains occupy the P site and extend toward the sarcin-ricin loop to interact with Tif6.

Using genetic tools and a novel RNA-tethering system, we investigated the interplay between HOTAIR and PRC2 in gene silencing. Surprisingly, we observed that forced overexpression of HOTAIR in breast cancer cells leads to subtle transcriptomic changes that appear to be independent of PRC2. Mechanistically, we found that artificial tethering of HOTAIR to chromatin causes transcriptional repression, but that this effect does not require PRC2. Instead, PRC2 recruitment appears to be a consequence of gene silencing.

We demonstrated that the human-specific pathogen Escherichia coli K1 uses its polysialic acid capsule as a molecular mimic to engage Siglec-11 and escape killing. In contrast, engagement of the activating counterpart Siglec-16 increases elimination of bacteria. Since mice do not have paired Siglec receptors, we generated a model by replacing the inhibitory domain of mouse Siglec-E with the activating module of Siglec-16. Siglec-E16 enhanced proinflammatory cytokine expression and bacterial killing in macrophages and boosted protection against intravenous bacterial challenge. These data elucidate uniquely human interactions of a pathogen with Siglecs and support the long-standing hypothesis that activating counterparts of paired immune receptors evolved as a response to pathogen molecular mimicry of host ligands for inhibitory receptors.",Paired Siglec receptors generate opposite inflammatory responses to a human-specific pathogen.,The EMBO journal
28100676,"Heterochromatin is marked by methylation of lysine 9 on histone H3 (H3K9me). A puzzling feature of H3K9me is that this modification localizes not only in promoters but also in internal regions (bodies) of silent transcription units. Despite its prevalence, the biological significance of gene-body H3K9me remains enigmatic. Here we show that H3K9me-associated removal of H3K4 monomethylation (H3K4me1) in gene bodies mediates transcriptional silencing. Mutations in an Arabidopsis H3K9 demethylase gene IBM1 induce ectopic H3K9me2 accumulation in gene bodies, with accompanying severe developmental defects. Through suppressor screening of the ibm1-induced developmental defects, we identified the LDL2 gene, which encodes a homolog of conserved H3K4 demethylases. The ldl2 mutation suppressed the developmental defects, without suppressing the ibm1-induced ectopic H3K9me2. The ectopic H3K9me2 mark directed removal of gene-body H3K4me1 and caused transcriptional repression in an LDL2-dependent manner. Furthermore, mutations of H3K9 methylases increased the level of H3K4me1 in the gene bodies of various transposable elements, and this H3K4me1 increase is a prerequisite for their transcriptional derepression. Our results uncover an unexpected role of gene-body H3K9me2/H3K4me1 dynamics as a mediator of heterochromatin silencing and epigenome differentiation.",Gene-body chromatin modification dynamics mediate epigenome differentiation in Arabidopsis.,The EMBO journal
28100675,"In innate immune responses, induction of type-I interferons (IFNs) prevents virus spreading while viral replication is delayed by protein synthesis inhibition. We asked how cells perform these apparently contradictory activities. Using single fibroblast monitoring by flow cytometry and mathematical modeling, we demonstrate that type-I IFN production is linked to cell's ability to enter dsRNA-activated PKR-dependent translational arrest and then overcome this inhibition by decreasing eIF2alpha phosphorylation through phosphatase 1c cofactor GADD34 (Ppp1r15a) expression. GADD34 expression, shown here to be dependent on the IRF3 transcription factor, is responsible for a biochemical cycle permitting pulse of IFN synthesis to occur in cells undergoing protein synthesis inhibition. Translation arrest is further demonstrated to be key for anti-viral response by acting synergistically with MAVS activation to amplify TBK1 signaling and IFN-beta mRNA transcription, while GADD34-dependent protein synthesis recovery contributes to the heterogeneous expression of IFN observed in dsRNA-activated cells.",Protein synthesis inhibition and GADD34 control IFN-beta heterogeneous expression in response to dsRNA.,The EMBO journal

28096179,"DNA repair by homologous recombination is under stringent cell cycle control. This includes the last step of the reaction, disentanglement of DNA joint molecules (JMs). Previous work has established that JM resolving nucleases are activated specifically at the onset of mitosis. In case of budding yeast Mus81-Mms4, this cell cycle stage-specific activation is known to depend on phosphorylation by CDK and Cdc5 kinases. Here, we show that a third cell cycle kinase, Cdc7-Dbf4 (DDK), targets Mus81-Mms4 in conjunction with Cdc5-both kinases bind to as well as phosphorylate Mus81-Mms4 in an interdependent manner. Moreover, DDK-mediated phosphorylation of Mms4 is strictly required for Mus81 activation in mitosis, establishing DDK as a novel regulator of homologous recombination. The scaffold protein Rtt107, which binds the Mus81-Mms4 complex, interacts with Cdc7 and thereby targets DDK and Cdc5 to the complex enabling full Mus81 activation. Therefore, Mus81 activation in mitosis involves at least three cell cycle kinases, CDK, Cdc5 and DDK Furthermore, tethering of the kinases in a stable complex with Mus81 is critical for efficient JM resolution.",Dbf4-dependent kinase and the Rtt107 scaffold promote Mus81-Mms4 resolvase activation during mitosis.,The EMBO journal

Consequently, it has emerged as an important therapeutic target in various malignancies. Nevertheless, the BRAF activation cycle still raises many mechanistic questions as illustrated by the paradoxical action and side effects of RAF inhibitors. By applying SEC-PCP-SILAC, we analyzed protein-protein interactions of hyperactive BRAF(V)(600E) and wild-type BRAF (BRAF(WT)). We identified two macromolecular, cytosolic BRAF complexes of distinct molecular composition and phosphorylation status. Hyperactive BRAF(V)(600E) resides in large complexes of higher molecular mass and activity, while BRAF(WT) is confined to smaller, slightly less active complexes. However, expression of oncogenic K-Ras(G12V), either by itself or in combination with RAF dimer promoting inhibitors, induces the incorporation of BRAF(WT) into large, active complexes, whereas pharmacological inhibition of BRAF(V)(600E) has the opposite effect. Thus, the quaternary structure of BRAF complexes is shaped by its activation status, the conformation of its kinase domain, and clinically relevant inhibitors.",Discrete cytosolic macromolecular BRAF complexes exhibit distinct activities and composition.,The EMBO journal
28093500,"Folding of proteins entering the secretory pathway in mammalian cells frequently requires the insertion of disulfide bonds. Disulfide insertion can result in covalent linkages found in the native structure as well as those that are not, so-called non-native disulfides. The pathways for disulfide formation are well characterized, but our understanding of how non-native disulfides are reduced so that the correct or native disulfides can form is poor. Here, we use a novel assay to demonstrate that the reduction in non-native disulfides requires NADPH as the ultimate electron donor, and a robust cytosolic thioredoxin system, driven by thioredoxin reductase 1 (TrxR1 or TXNRD1). Inhibition of this reductive pathway prevents the correct folding and secretion of proteins that are known to form non-native disulfides during their folding. Hence, we have shown for the first time that mammalian cells have a pathway for transferring reducing equivalents from the cytosol to the ER, which is required to ensure correct disulfide formation in proteins entering the secretory pathway.",Cytosolic thioredoxin reductase 1 is required for correct disulfide formation in the ER.,The EMBO journal

However, when and how ISCs are established during embryogenesis remains unknown. We show here that the transcription regulator Id2 controls the specification of embryonic Lgr5(+) progenitors in the developing murine small intestine. Cell fate mapping analysis revealed that Lgr5(+) progenitors emerge at E13.5 in wild-type embryos and differ from the rest on the intestinal epithelium by a characteristic ISC signature. In the absence of Id2, the intestinal epithelium differentiates into Lgr5(+) cells already at E9.5. Furthermore, the size of the Lgr5(+) cell pool is significantly increased. We show that Id2 restricts the activity of the Wnt signalling pathway at early stages and prevents precocious differentiation of the embryonic intestinal epithelium. Id2-deficient embryonic epithelial cells cultured ex vivo strongly activate Wnt target genes as well as markers of neoplastic transformation and form fast growing undifferentiated spheroids. Furthermore, adult ISCs from Id2-deficient mice display a distinct transcriptional signature, supporting an essential role for Id2 in the correct specification of ISCs.",Id2 controls specification of Lgr5(+) intestinal stem cell progenitors during gut development.,The EMBO journal

Silent synapse-based NAc remodeling was shown to be critical for several drug-induced behaviors, but its role in acquisition and retention of the association between drug rewarding effects and drug-associated contexts has remained unclear. Here, we find that the postsynaptic proteins PSD-93, PSD-95, and SAP102 differentially regulate excitatory synapse properties in the NAc. Mice deficient for either of these scaffold proteins exhibit distinct maturation patterns of silent synapses and thus provided instructive animal models to examine the role of NAc silent synapse maturation in cocaine-conditioned place preference (CPP). Wild-type and knockout mice alike all acquired cocaine-CPP and exhibited increased levels of silent synapses after drug-context conditioning. However, the mice differed in CPP retention and CP-AMPAR incorporation. Collectively, our results indicate that CP-AMPAR-mediated maturation of silent synapses in the NAc is a signature of drug-context association, but this maturation is not required for establishing or retaining cocaine-CPP.",Calcium-permeable AMPA receptors and silent synapses in cocaine-conditioned place preference.,The EMBO journal
28069708,"Ubiquitylation controls protein function and degradation. Therefore, ubiquitin ligases need to be tightly controlled. We discovered an evolutionarily conserved allosteric restraint mechanism for Nedd4 ligases and demonstrated its function with diverse substrates: the yeast soluble proteins Rpn10 and Rvs167, and the human receptor tyrosine kinase FGFR1 and cardiac IKS potassium channel. We found that a potential trimerization interface is structurally blocked by the HECT domain alpha1-helix, which further undergoes ubiquitylation on a conserved lysine residue. Genetic, bioinformatics, biochemical and biophysical data show that attraction between this alpha1-conjugated ubiquitin and the HECT ubiquitin-binding patch pulls the alpha1-helix out of the interface, thereby promoting trimerization. Strikingly, trimerization renders the ligase inactive. Arginine substitution of the ubiquitylated lysine impairs this inactivation mechanism and results in unrestrained FGFR1 ubiquitylation in cells. Similarly, electrophysiological data and TIRF microscopy show that NEDD4 unrestrained mutant constitutively downregulates the IKS channel, thus confirming the functional importance of E3-ligase autoinhibition.",Ubiquitylation-dependent oligomerization regulates activity of Nedd4 ligases.,The EMBO journal

Given that the propagation of DNA methylation at CpG sites, mediated in Arabidopsis by MET1, plays a central role in epigenetic inheritance, we examined genomewide DNA methylation in partial and complete loss-of-function met1 mutants. We interpreted the data in relation to transgenerational epiallelic stability, which allowed us to classify chromosomal targets of epigenetic regulation into (i) single copy and methylated exclusively at CpGs, readily forming epialleles, and (ii) transposon-derived, methylated at all cytosines, which may or may not form epialleles. We provide evidence that DNA sequence features such as density of CpGs and genomic repetitiveness of the loci predispose their susceptibility to epiallelic switching. The importance and predictive power of these genetic features were confirmed by analyses of common epialleles in natural Arabidopsis accessions, epigenetic recombinant inbred lines (epiRILs) and also verified in rice.",DNA sequence properties that predict susceptibility to epiallelic switching.,The EMBO journal

The translational efficiencies of mRNAs in cells progressing synchronously through the mitotic cell cycle, while preserving the coupling of cell division with cell growth, remain uninvestigated. We now report comprehensive ribosome profiling of a yeast cell size series from the time of cell birth, to identify mRNAs under periodic translational control. The data reveal coordinate translational activation of mRNAs encoding lipogenic enzymes late in the cell cycle including Acc1p, the rate-limiting enzyme acetyl-CoA carboxylase. An upstream open reading frame (uORF) confers the translational control of ACC1 and adjusts Acc1p protein levels in different nutrients. The ACC1 uORF is relevant for cell division because its ablation delays cell cycle progression, reduces cell size, and suppresses the replicative longevity of cells lacking the Sch9p protein kinase regulator of ribosome biogenesis.

However, the proteolytic substrates of MarP that mediate these phenotypes were unknown. Here, we used biochemical methods coupled with supravital chemical probes that facilitate imaging of nascent peptidoglycan to demonstrate that during acid stress MarP cleaves the peptidoglycan hydrolase RipA, a process required for RipA's activation. Failure of RipA processing in MarP-deficient cells leads to cell elongation and chain formation, a hallmark of progeny cell separation arrest.

Additionally, aberrant signaling by the secreted protein angiopoietin-like protein 2 (ANGPTL2) causes chronic inflammation in a variety of diseases. However, little is known about the physiologic role of ANGPTL2 in normal tissue homeostasis and during wound repair following injury. Here, we assessed ANGPTL2 function in intestinal physiology and disease in vivo Although intestinal development proceeded normally in Angptl2-deficient mice, expression levels of the intestinal stem cell (ISC) marker gene Lgr5 decreased, which was associated with decreased transcriptional activity of beta-catenin in Angptl2-deficient mice. Epithelial regeneration after injury was significantly impaired in Angptl2-deficient relative to wild-type mice. ANGPTL2 was expressed and functioned within the mesenchymal compartment cells known as intestinal subepithelial myofibroblasts (ISEMFs). ANGPTL2 derived from ISEMFs maintained the intestinal stem cell niche by modulating levels of competing signaling between bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and beta-catenin.

This interaction allows MRTF to recruit NcoA3 to the TEAD-YAP transcriptional complex and potentiate its transcriptional activity. We show this interaction of MRTF and YAP is critical for LPA-induced cancer cell invasion in vitro and breast cancer metastasis to the lung in vivo We also demonstrate the significance of MRTF-YAP binding in regulation of YAP activity upon acute actin cytoskeletal damage. Acute actin disruption induces nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of MRTF, and this process underlies the LATS-independent regulation of YAP activity.

We demonstrate that kinesin-1 recruitment requires the DmTropomyosin1-I/C isoform, an atypical RNA-binding tropomyosin that binds directly to dimerizing oskar 3'UTRs. Finally, we show that a small but dynamically changing subset of oskar mRNPs gets loaded with inactive kinesin-1 and that the motor is activated during mid-oogenesis by the functionalized spliced oskar RNA localization element. This inefficient, dynamic recruitment of Khc decoupled from cargo-dependent motor activation constitutes an optimized, coordinated mechanism of mRNP transport, by minimizing interference with other cargo-transport processes and between the cargo-associated dynein and kinesin-1.",An RNA-binding atypical tropomyosin recruits kinesin-1 dynamically to oskar mRNPs.,The EMBO journal

Ectopic DV polarization was also demonstrated in gain-of-function mutant animals for C. elegans RhoG MIG-2. We identified serine 139 of MIG-2 as a novel conserved Hippo kinase phosphorylation site and demonstrated that purified Hippo kinases directly phosphorylate MIG-2(S139) Live imaging analysis of genome-edited animals indicates that MIG-2(S139) phosphorylation impedes actin assembly in migrating cells. Intriguingly, Hippo kinases are excluded from the leading edge in wild-type cells, while MIG-2 loss induces uniform distribution of Hippo kinases.

Using genomic techniques, quantitative cell imaging, and mathematical modeling, our study in Caulobacter crescentus identifies a novel NAP (GapR) whose activity over the cell cycle is shaped by DNA replication. GapR activity is critical for cellular function, as loss of GapR causes severe, pleiotropic defects in growth, cell division, DNA replication, and chromosome segregation. GapR also affects global gene expression with a chromosomal bias from origin to terminus, which is associated with a similar general bias in GapR binding activity along the chromosome. Strikingly, this asymmetric localization cannot be explained by the distribution of GapR binding sites on the chromosome. Instead, we present a mechanistic model in which the spatiotemporal dynamics of GapR are primarily driven by the progression of the replication forks.

Resolution at telomeres requires the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase tankyrase 1, but the mechanism that times its action is unknown. Here, we show that tankyrase 1 activity at telomeres is controlled by a ubiquitination/deubiquitination cycle depending on opposing ubiquitin ligase and deubiquitinase activities. In late S/G2 phase, the DNA damage-responsive E3 ligase RNF8 conjugates K63-linked ubiquitin chains to tankyrase 1, while in G1 phase such ubiquitin chains are removed by BRISC, an ABRO1/BRCC36-containing deubiquitinase complex. We show that K63-linked ubiquitin chains accumulate on tankyrase 1 in late S/G2 to promote its stabilization, association with telomeres, and resolution of cohesion. Timing of this posttranslational modification coincides with the ATM-mediated DNA damage response that occurs on functional telomeres following replication in G2. Removal of ubiquitin chains is controlled by ABRO1/BRCC36 and occurs as cells exit mitosis and enter G1, ensuring that telomere cohesion is not resolved prematurely in S phase.

Although generally characterized by different DNA elements, chromatin architecture and cofactors, it is not known to what degree promoter classes strictly follow regulatability rules and which molecular mechanisms dictate such differences. We show that SAGA-dominated/TATA-box promoters are more responsive to changes in the amount of activator, even compared to TFIID/TATA-like promoters that depend on the same activator Hsf1. Regulatability is therefore an inherent property of promoter class. Further analyses show that SAGA/TATA-box promoters are more dynamic because TATA-binding protein recruitment through SAGA is susceptible to removal by Mot1. In addition, the nucleosome configuration upon activator depletion shifts on SAGA/TATA-box promoters and seems less amenable to preinitiation complex formation.

In contrast, Sharpin(cpdm) mammary epithelial cells transplanted in vivo into wild-type stroma, fully repopulate the mammary gland fat pad, undergo unperturbed ductal outgrowth and terminal differentiation. Thus, SHARPIN is required in mammary gland stroma during development. Accordingly, stroma adjacent to invading mammary ducts of Sharpin(cpdm) mice displayed reduced collagen arrangement and extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness. Moreover, Sharpin(cpdm) mammary gland stromal fibroblasts demonstrated defects in collagen fibre assembly, collagen contraction and degradation in vitro Together, these data imply that SHARPIN regulates the normal invasive mammary gland branching morphogenesis in an epithelial cell extrinsic manner by controlling the organisation of the stromal ECM.",SHARPIN regulates collagen architecture and ductal outgrowth in the developing mouse mammary gland.,The EMBO journal
27940654,"Shear detection and mechanotransduction by arterial endothelium requires junctional complexes containing PECAM-1 and VE-cadherin, as well as firm anchorage to the underlying basement membrane. While considerable information is available for junctional complexes in these processes, gained largely from in vitro studies, little is known about the contribution of the endothelial basement membrane. Using resistance artery explants, we show that the integral endothelial basement membrane component, laminin 511 (laminin alpha5), is central to shear detection and mechanotransduction and its elimination at this site results in ablation of dilation in response to increased shear stress. Loss of endothelial laminin 511 correlates with reduced cortical stiffness of arterial endothelium in vivo, smaller integrin beta1-positive/vinculin-positive focal adhesions, and reduced junctional association of actin-myosin II In vitro assays reveal that beta1 integrin-mediated interaction with laminin 511 results in high strengths of adhesion, which promotes p120 catenin association with VE-cadherin, stabilizing it at cell junctions and increasing cell-cell adhesion strength. This highlights the importance of endothelial laminin 511 in shear response in the physiologically relevant context of resistance arteries.",Endothelial basement membrane laminin 511 is essential for shear stress response.,The EMBO journal
27940653,"Understanding how complex tissues are formed, maintained, and regenerated through local growth, differentiation, and remodeling requires knowledge on how single-cell behaviors are coordinated on the population level. The self-renewing hair follicle, maintained by a distinct stem cell population, represents an excellent paradigm to address this question. A major obstacle in mechanistic understanding of hair follicle stem cell (HFSC) regulation has been the lack of a culture system that recapitulates HFSC behavior while allowing their precise monitoring and manipulation. Here, we establish an in vitro culture system based on a 3D extracellular matrix environment and defined soluble factors, which for the first time allows expansion and long-term maintenance of murine multipotent HFSCs in the absence of heterologous cell types. Strikingly, this scheme promotes de novo generation of HFSCs from non-HFSCs and vice versa in a dynamic self-organizing process. This bidirectional interconversion of HFSCs and their progeny drives the system into a population equilibrium state. Our study uncovers regulatory dynamics by which phenotypic plasticity of cells drives population-level homeostasis within a niche, and provides a discovery tool for studies on adult stem cell fate.",Hair follicle stem cell cultures reveal self-organizing plasticity of stem cells and their progeny.,The EMBO journal
27932448,"Autophagy is a process delivering cytoplasmic components to lysosomes for degradation. Autophagy may, however, play a role in unconventional secretion of leaderless cytosolic proteins. How secretory autophagy diverges from degradative autophagy remains unclear. Here we show that in response to lysosomal damage, the prototypical cytosolic secretory autophagy cargo IL-1beta is recognized by specialized secretory autophagy cargo receptor TRIM16 and that this receptor interacts with the R-SNARE Sec22b to recruit cargo to the LC3-II(+) sequestration membranes. Cargo secretion is unaffected by downregulation of syntaxin 17, a SNARE promoting autophagosome-lysosome fusion and cargo degradation. Instead, Sec22b in combination with plasma membrane syntaxin 3 and syntaxin 4 as well as SNAP-23 and SNAP-29 completes cargo secretion. Thus, secretory autophagy utilizes a specialized cytosolic cargo receptor and a dedicated SNARE system. Other unconventionally secreted cargo, such as ferritin, is secreted via the same pathway.",Dedicated SNAREs and specialized TRIM cargo receptors mediate secretory autophagy.,The EMBO journal
27932447,"Cells use homology-dependent DNA repair to mend chromosome breaks and restore broken replication forks, thereby ensuring genome stability and cell survival. DNA break repair via homology-based mechanisms involves nuclease-dependent DNA end resection, which generates long tracts of single-stranded DNA required for checkpoint activation and loading of homologous recombination proteins Rad52/51/55/57. While recruitment of the homologous recombination machinery is well characterized, it is not known how its presence at repair loci is coordinated with downstream re-synthesis of resected DNA We show that Rad51 inhibits recruitment of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), the platform for assembly of the DNA replication machinery, and that unloading of Rad51 by Srs2 helicase is required for efficient PCNA loading and restoration of resected DNA As a result, srs2Delta mutants are deficient in DNA repair correlating with extensive DNA processing, but this defect in srs2Delta mutants can be suppressed by inactivation of the resection nuclease Exo1. We propose a model in which during re-synthesis of resected DNA, the replication machinery must catch up with the preceding processing nucleases, in order to close the single-stranded gap and terminate further resection.",Unloading of homologous recombination factors is required for restoring double-stranded DNA at damage repair loci.,The EMBO journal
27932446,"Ribonuclease activity of topoisomerase I (Top1) causes DNA nicks bearing 2',3'-cyclic phosphates at ribonucleotide sites. Here, we provide genetic and biochemical evidence that DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) can be directly generated by Top1 at sites of genomic ribonucleotides. We show that RNase H2-deficient yeast cells displayed elevated frequency of Rad52 foci, inactivation of RNase H2 and RAD52 led to synthetic lethality, and combined loss of RNase H2 and RAD51 induced slow growth and replication stress. Importantly, these phenotypes were rescued upon additional deletion of TOP1, implicating homologous recombination for the repair of Top1-induced damage at ribonuclelotide sites. We demonstrate biochemically that irreversible DSBs are generated by subsequent Top1 cleavage on the opposite strand from the Top1-induced DNA nicks at ribonucleotide sites. Analysis of Top1-linked DNA from pull-down experiments revealed that Top1 is covalently linked to the end of DNA in RNase H2-deficient yeast cells, supporting this model. Taken together, these results define Top1 as a source of DSBs and genome instability when ribonucleotides incorporated by the replicative polymerases are not removed by RNase H2.",Topoisomerase I-mediated cleavage at unrepaired ribonucleotides generates DNA double-strand breaks.,The EMBO journal

Here, we implicate the transcription factor Gata6 in adult mouse hair follicle regeneration where it controls the renewal of rapidly proliferating epithelial (matrix) progenitors and hence the extent of production of terminally differentiated lineages. We find that Gata6 protects against DNA damage associated with proliferation, thus preventing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Furthermore, we show that in vivo Gata6 stimulates EDA-receptor signaling adaptor Edaradd level and NF-kappaB pathway activation, known to be important for DNA damage repair and stress response in general and for hair follicle growth in particular. In cultured keratinocytes, Edaradd rescues DNA damage, cell survival, and proliferation of Gata6 knockout cells and restores MCM10 expression. Our data add to recent evidence in embryonic stem and neural progenitor cells, suggesting a model whereby developmentally regulated transcription factors protect from DNA damage associated with proliferation at key stages of rapid tissue growth.

Here, we show that seipin is stably associated with nascent ER-LD contacts in human cells, typically via one mobile focal point per LD Seipin appears critical for such contacts since ER-LD contacts were completely missing or morphologically aberrant in seipin knockout and BSCL2 patient cells. In parallel, LD mobility was increased and protein delivery from the ER to LDs to promote LD growth was decreased. Moreover, while growing LDs normally acquire lipid and protein constituents from the ER, this process was compromised in seipin-deficient cells. In the absence of seipin, the initial synthesis of neutral lipids from exogenous fatty acid was normal, but fatty acid incorporation into neutral lipids in cells with pre-existing LDs was impaired. Together, our data suggest that seipin helps to connect newly formed LDs to the ER and that by stabilizing ER-LD contacts seipin facilitates the incorporation of protein and lipid cargo into growing LDs in human cells.",Seipin regulates ER-lipid droplet contacts and cargo delivery.,The EMBO journal

However, it is unclear what the physiological functions of AhR in B cells are. We show here that expression of Ahr in B cells is up-regulated upon B-cell receptor (BCR) engagement and IL-4 treatment. Addition of a natural ligand of AhR, FICZ, induces AhR translocation to the nucleus and transcription of the AhR target gene Cyp1a1, showing that the AhR pathway is functional in B cells. AhR-deficient (Ahr(-/-)) B cells proliferate less than AhR-sufficient (Ahr(+/+)) cells following in vitro BCR stimulation and in vivo adoptive transfer models confirmed that Ahr(-/-) B cells are outcompeted by Ahr(+/+) cells.

The dynamic association of cohesin with chromatin is essential for these functions. However, the exact nature of cohesin dynamics, particularly cohesin translocation, remains unclear. We evaluated the dynamics of individual cohesin molecules on DNA and found that the cohesin core complex possesses an intrinsic ability to traverse DNA in an adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase)-dependent manner. Translocation ability is suppressed in the presence of Wapl-Pds5 and Sororin; this suppression is alleviated by the acetylation of cohesin and the action of mitotic kinases. In Xenopus laevis egg extracts, cohesin is translocated on unreplicated DNA in an ATPase- and Smc3 acetylation-dependent manner. Cohesin movement changes from bidirectional to unidirectional when cohesin faces DNA replication; otherwise, it is incorporated into replicating DNA without being translocated or is dissociated from replicating DNA This study provides insight into the nature of individual cohesin dynamics and the mechanisms by which cohesin achieves cohesion in different chromatin contexts.",Cohesin acetylation and Wapl-Pds5 oppositely regulate translocation of cohesin along DNA.,The EMBO journal

Here we show that activation of Group I mGluRs in medium spiny neurons induces trafficking of GluA2 from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the synapse by enhancing GluA2 binding to essential COPII vesicle proteins, Sec23 and Sec13. GluA2 exit from the ER further depends on IP3 and Ryanodine receptor-controlled Ca(2+) release as well as active translation. Synaptic insertion of GluA2 is coupled to removal of high-conducting Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptors from synapses, resulting in synaptic depression. This work demonstrates a novel mechanism in which mGluR signals release AMPA receptors rapidly from the ER and couple ER release to GluA2 synaptic insertion and GluA1 removal.",mGluR long-term depression regulates GluA2 association with COPII vesicles and exit from the endoplasmic reticulum.,The EMBO journal
27852626,"The transcription factor ISGF3, comprised of IRF9 and tyrosine-phosphorylated STATs 1 and 2, transmits the signal from the type I interferon receptor to the genome. We have discovered a novel phosphorylation of STAT2 on T387 that negatively regulates this response. In most untreated cell types, the majority of STAT2 is phosphorylated on T387 constitutively. In response to interferon-beta, the T387A mutant of STAT2 is much more effective than wild-type STAT2 in mediating the expression of many interferon-stimulated genes, in protecting cells against virus infection, and in inhibiting cell growth. Interferon-beta-treated cells expressing wild-type STAT2 contain much less ISGF3 capable of binding to an interferon-stimulated response element than do cells expressing T387A STAT2. T387 lies in a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) consensus sequence, and CDK inhibitors decrease T387 phosphorylation.

27852625,"Cells are constantly threatened by multiple sources of genotoxic stress that cause DNA damage. To maintain genome integrity, cells have developed a coordinated signalling network called DNA damage response (DDR). While multiple kinases have been thoroughly studied during DDR activation, the role of protein dephosphorylation in the damage response remains elusive. Here, we show that the phosphatase Cdc14 is essential to fulfil recombinational DNA repair in budding yeast. After DNA double-strand break (DSB) generation, Cdc14 is transiently released from the nucleolus and activated. In this state, Cdc14 targets the spindle pole body (SPB) component Spc110 to counterbalance its phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk). Alterations in the Cdk/Cdc14-dependent phosphorylation status of Spc110, or its inactivation during the induction of a DNA lesion, generate abnormal oscillatory SPB movements that disrupt DSB-SPB interactions. Remarkably, these defects impair DNA repair by homologous recombination indicating that SPB integrity is essential during the repair process. Together, these results show that Cdc14 promotes spindle stability and DSB-SPB tethering during DNA repair, and imply that metaphase spindle maintenance is a critical feature of the repair process.",Stabilization of the metaphase spindle by Cdc14 is required for recombinational DNA repair.,The EMBO journal

However, our understanding of sRNA function has lagged behind their identification due to a lack of tools for the high-throughput analysis of RNA-RNA interactions in bacteria. Here we demonstrate that in vivo sRNA-mRNA duplexes can be recovered using UV-crosslinking, ligation and sequencing of hybrids (CLASH). Many sRNAs recruit the endoribonuclease, RNase E, to facilitate processing of mRNAs. We were able to recover base-paired sRNA-mRNA duplexes in association with RNase E, allowing proximity-dependent ligation and sequencing of cognate sRNA-mRNA pairs as chimeric reads. We verified that this approach captures bona fide sRNA-mRNA interactions. Clustering analyses identified novel sRNA seed regions and sets of potentially co-regulated target mRNAs. We identified multiple mRNA targets for the pathotype-specific sRNA Esr41, which was shown to regulate colicin sensitivity and iron transport in E. coli Numerous sRNA interactions were also identified with non-coding RNAs, including sRNAs and tRNAs, demonstrating the high complexity of the sRNA interactome.",Small RNA interactome of pathogenic E. coli revealed through crosslinking of RNase E.,The EMBO journal

Epiboly is an essential embryonic event in which three tissues coordinate to direct the expansion of the blastoderm. How and where forces are generated during epiboly, and how these are globally coupled remains elusive. Here we developed a method, hydrodynamic regression (HR), to infer 3D pressure fields, mechanical power, and cortical surface tension profiles. HR is based on velocity measurements retrieved from 2D+T microscopy and their hydrodynamic modeling. We applied HR to identify biomechanically active structures and changes in cortex local tension during epiboly in zebrafish. Based on our results, we propose a novel physical description for epiboly, where tissue movements are directed by a polarized gradient of cortical tension. We found that this gradient relies on local contractile forces at the cortex, differences in elastic properties between cortex components and the passive transmission of forces within the yolk cell. All in all, our work identifies a novel way to physically regulate concerted cellular movements that might be instrumental for the mechanical control of many morphogenetic processes.",Polarized cortical tension drives zebrafish epiboly movements.,The EMBO journal

However, the exact mechanism by which IL-1 is involved in the generation of pathogenic T cells and in disease development remains largely unknown. We found that following EAE induction, pertussis toxin administration leads to IL-1 receptor type 1 (IL-1R1)-dependent IL-1beta expression by myeloid cells in the draining lymph nodes. This myeloid-derived IL-1beta did not vitally contribute to the generation and plasticity of Th17 cells, but rather promoted the expansion of a GM-CSF(+) Th17 cell subset, thereby enhancing its encephalitogenic potential. Lack of expansion of GM-CSF-producing Th17 cells led to ameliorated disease in mice deficient for IL-1R1 specifically in T cells. Importantly, pathogenicity of IL-1R1-deficient T cells was fully restored by IL-23 polarization and expansion in vitro Therefore, our data demonstrate that IL-1 functions as a mitogenic mediator of encephalitogenic Th17 cells rather than qualitative inducer of their generation.",IL-1 signaling is critical for expansion but not generation of autoreactive GM-CSF+ Th17 cells.,The EMBO journal

In contrast, it is controversial whether it acts in chordates. Rather, in vertebrates, viral RNAs induce a distinct defence system known as the interferon (IFN) response. Here, we tested the possibility that the IFN response masks or inhibits antiviral RNAi in mammalian cells. Consistent with that notion, we find that sequence-specific gene silencing can be triggered by long dsRNAs in differentiated mouse cells rendered deficient in components of the IFN pathway. This unveiled response is dependent on the canonical RNAi machinery and is lost upon treatment of IFN-responsive cells with type I IFN Notably, transfection with long dsRNA specifically vaccinates IFN-deficient cells against infection with viruses bearing a homologous sequence.

Research of the past three decades has focused on understanding how dynamin works. In this review, we present the basis for an emerging consensus on how dynamin functions. Three properties of dynamin are strongly supported by experimental data: first, dynamin oligomerizes into a helical polymer; second, dynamin oligomer constricts in the presence of GTP; and third, dynamin catalyzes membrane fission upon GTP hydrolysis. We present the two current models for fission, essentially diverging in how GTP energy is spent.

Proteolytic release of fission yeast SREBPs from the membrane in response to low oxygen requires the Golgi membrane-anchored Dsc E3 ligase complex. Using genetic interaction arrays, we identified Rbd2 as a rhomboid family protease required for SREBP proteolytic processing. Rbd2 is an active, Golgi-localized protease that cleaves the transmembrane segment of the TatA rhomboid model substrate. Epistasis analysis revealed that the Dsc E3 ligase acts on SREBP prior to cleavage by Rbd2. Using APEX2 proximity biotinylation, we demonstrated that Rbd2 binds the AAA-ATPase Cdc48 through a C-terminal SHP box. Interestingly, SREBP cleavage required Rbd2 binding of Cdc48, consistent with Cdc48 acting to recruit ubiquitinylated substrates. In support of this claim, overexpressing a Cdc48-binding mutant of Rbd2 bypassed the Cdc48 requirement for SREBP cleavage, demonstrating that Cdc48 likely plays a role in SREBP recognition. In the absence of functional Rbd2, SREBP precursor is degraded by the proteasome, indicating that Rbd2 activity controls the balance between SREBP activation and degradation.",A Golgi rhomboid protease Rbd2 recruits Cdc48 to cleave yeast SREBP.,The EMBO journal

Here, we identify the zebrafish transcriptional regulator evi1 as critically required for Notch-mediated EHT In vivo live imaging studies indicate that evi1 suppression impairs EC progression to hematopoietic fate and therefore HSC emergence. evi1 is expressed in ECs and induces these effects cell autonomously by activating Notch via pAKT Global or endothelial-specific induction of notch, vegf, or pAKT can restore endothelial Notch and HSC formations in evi1 morphants. Significantly, evi1 overexpression induces Notch independently of Vegf and rescues HSC numbers in embryos treated with a Vegf inhibitor.

We have now analysed the BCR oligomer opening and signalling upon treatment with different monovalent stimuli. Our results indicate that monovalent antigens are able to disturb and open the BCR oligomer, but that this requires the presence and activity of the Src family kinase (SFK) Lyn. We have also shown that monovalent Fab fragments of anti-BCR antibodies can open the BCR oligomers as long as they directly interact with the antigen-binding site.

Here, we show that TDP-43 knockdown specifically reduces the number and motility of RAB11-positive recycling endosomes in dendrites, while TDP-43 overexpression has the opposite effect. This is associated with delayed transferrin recycling in TDP-43-knockdown neurons and decreased beta2-transferrin levels in patient CSF Whole proteome quantification identified the upregulation of the ESCRT component VPS4B upon TDP-43 knockdown in neurons. Luciferase reporter assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation suggest that TDP-43 represses VPS4B transcription. Preventing VPS4B upregulation or expression of its functional antagonist ALIX restores trafficking of recycling endosomes. Proteomic analysis revealed the broad reduction in surface expression of key receptors upon TDP-43 knockdown, including ErbB4, the neuregulin 1 receptor. TDP-43 knockdown delays the surface delivery of ErbB4. ErbB4 overexpression, but not neuregulin 1 stimulation, prevents dendrite loss upon TDP-43 knockdown.

Polycomb-repressive complexes (PRCs) act synergistically during development and differentiation by maintaining transcriptional repression of common genes. PRC2 exerts this activity by catalysing H3K27 trimethylation. Here, we show that in the intestinal epithelium PRC2 is required to sustain progenitor cell proliferation and the correct balance between secretory and absorptive lineage differentiation programs. Using genetic models, we show that PRC2 activity is largely dispensable for intestinal stem cell maintenance but is strictly required for radiation-induced regeneration by preventing Cdkn2a transcription. Combining these models with genomewide molecular analysis, we further demonstrate that preferential accumulation of secretory cells does not result from impaired proliferation of progenitor cells induced by Cdkn2a activation but rather from direct regulation of transcription factors responsible for secretory lineage commitment. Overall, our data uncover a dual role of PRC2 in intestinal homeostasis highlighting the importance of this repressive layer in controlling cell plasticity and lineage choices in adult tissues.",PRC2 preserves intestinal progenitors and restricts secretory lineage commitment.,The EMBO journal

Here, we examined the effects of aneuploidy on mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells by generating a series of cell lines that each carries an extra copy of single chromosomes, including trisomy 6, 8, 11, 12, or 15. Most of these aneuploid cell lines had rapid proliferation rates and enhanced colony formation efficiencies. They were less dependent on growth factors for self-renewal and showed a reduced capacity to differentiate in vitro Moreover, trisomic stem cells formed teratomas more efficiently, from which undifferentiated cells can be recovered.

However, whether cohesin can translocate along DNA is unknown. Here, we used single-molecule imaging to show that cohesin can diffuse rapidly on DNA in a manner consistent with topological entrapment and can pass over some DNA-bound proteins and nucleosomes but is constrained in its movement by transcription and DNA-bound CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF). These results indicate that cohesin can be positioned in the genome by moving along DNA, that transcription can provide directionality to these movements, that CTCF functions as a boundary element for moving cohesin, and they are consistent with the hypothesis that cohesin spatially organizes the genome via loop extrusion.",Rapid movement and transcriptional re-localization of human cohesin on DNA.,The EMBO journal

Using the same approach to map TFIID, we find that TFIID is associated with both TFIID- and SAGA-dependent genes and that TFIID and Mediator occupancy is cooperative.

Following disruption of the intestinal epithelium, wound-associated epithelial (WAE) cells form the initial barrier over the wound.

WAE cell differentiation was a permanent state and dominant over enterocyte differentiation in plasticity experiments. WAE cell differentiation was triggered by nuclear beta-catenin signaling independent of canonical Wnt signaling. Creation of WAE cells via the PGE2-Ptger4 pathway was required in vivo, as mice with loss of Ptger4 in the intestinal epithelium did not produce WAE cells and exhibited impaired wound repair.

The presented data suggest that the timely removal of ERAL1 from the small ribosomal subunit is essential for the efficient maturation of the mitoribosome and a normal rate of mitochondrial translation.",CLPP coordinates mitoribosomal assembly through the regulation of ERAL1 levels.,The EMBO journal
27797819,"Interfollicular epidermal (IFE) homeostasis is a major physiological process allowing maintenance of the skin barrier function. Despite progress in our understanding of stem cell populations in different hair follicle compartments, cellular mechanisms of IFE maintenance, in particular, whether a hierarchy of progenitors exists within this compartment, have remained controversial. We here used multicolour lineage tracing with Brainbow transgenic labels activated in the epidermis to track individual keratinocyte clones. Two modes of clonal progression could be observed in the adult murine dorsal skin. Clones attached to hair follicles showed rapid increase in size during the growth phase of the hair cycle. On the other hand, clones distant from hair follicles were slow cycling, but could be mobilized by a proliferative stimulus. Reinforced by mathematical modelling, these data support a model where progenitor cycling characteristics are differentially regulated in areas surrounding or away from growing hair follicles. Thus, while IFE progenitors follow a non-hierarchical mode of development, spatiotemporal control by their environment can change their potentialities, with far-reaching implications for epidermal homeostasis, wound repair and cancer development.",Bimodal behaviour of interfollicular epidermal progenitors regulated by hair follicle position and cycling.,The EMBO journal
27797818,"Homologous recombination (HR) is a key pathway that repairs DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and helps to restart stalled or collapsed replication forks. How HR supports replication upon genotoxic stress is not understood. Using in vivo and in vitro approaches, we show that the MMS22L-TONSL heterodimer localizes to replication forks under unperturbed conditions and its recruitment is increased during replication stress in human cells. MMS22L-TONSL associates with replication protein A (RPA)-coated ssDNA, and the MMS22L subunit directly interacts with the strand exchange protein RAD51. MMS22L is required for proper RAD51 assembly at DNA damage sites in vivo, and HR-mediated repair of stalled forks is abrogated in cells expressing a MMS22L mutant deficient in RAD51 interaction. Similar to the recombination mediator BRCA2, recombinant MMS22L-TONSL limits the assembly of RAD51 on dsDNA, which stimulates RAD51-ssDNA nucleoprotein filament formation and RAD51-dependent strand exchange activity in vitro Thus, by specifically regulating RAD51 activity at uncoupled replication forks, MMS22L-TONSL stabilizes perturbed replication forks by promoting replication fork reversal and stimulating their HR-mediated restart in vivo.",The MMS22L-TONSL heterodimer directly promotes RAD51-dependent recombination upon replication stress.,The EMBO journal

However, the lack of structural data on the human immunoproteasome still hampers drug design. Here, we systematically determined the potency of seven alpha' beta' epoxyketone inhibitors with varying N-caps and P3-stereochemistry for mouse/human beta5c/beta5i and found pronounced differences in their subunit and species selectivity. Using X-ray crystallography, the compounds were analyzed for their modes of binding to chimeric yeast proteasomes that incorporate key parts of human beta5c, human beta5i or mouse beta5i and the neighboring beta6 subunit. The structural data reveal exceptional conformations for the most selective human beta5i inhibitors and highlight subtle structural differences as the major reason for the observed species selectivity. Altogether, the presented results validate the humanized yeast proteasome as a powerful tool for structure-based development of beta5i inhibitors with potential clinical applications.",A humanized yeast proteasome identifies unique binding modes of inhibitors for the immunosubunit beta5i.,The EMBO journal

Here, we identified an essential role for the ubiquitin-directed AAA-ATPase, p97, in the clearance of damaged lysosomes by autophagy. Upon damage, p97 translocates to lysosomes and there cooperates with a distinct set of cofactors including UBXD1, PLAA, and the deubiquitinating enzyme YOD1, which we term ELDR components for Endo-Lysosomal Damage Response. Together, they act downstream of K63-linked ubiquitination and p62 recruitment, and selectively remove K48-linked ubiquitin conjugates from a subpopulation of damaged lysosomes to promote autophagosome formation. Lysosomal clearance is also compromised in MEFs harboring a p97 mutation that causes inclusion body myopathy and neurodegeneration, and damaged lysosomes accumulate in affected patient tissue carrying the mutation. Moreover, we show that p97 helps clear late endosomes/lysosomes ruptured by endocytosed tau fibrils. Thus, our data reveal an important mechanism of how p97 maintains lysosomal homeostasis, and implicate the pathway as a modulator of degenerative diseases.","VCP/p97 cooperates with YOD1, UBXD1 and PLAA to drive clearance of ruptured lysosomes by autophagy.",The EMBO journal

However, the regulatory mechanism underlying TBK1 activation remains unclear. Here we report that Raf kinase inhibitory protein (RKIP) is essential for TBK1 activation and type I interferon production triggered by viral infection. Upon viral infection, RKIP is phosphorylated at serine 109 (S109) by TBK1. Phosphorylation of RKIP enhances its interaction with TBK1 and in turn promotes TBK1 autophosphorylation. Mutation of RKIP S109 to alanine abrogates the interaction between RKIP and TBK1, and the anti-viral function of RKIP RKIP deficiency inhibits intracellular double-stranded RNA- or DNA-induced type I interferon production. Consistently, RKIP deficiency renders the mice more susceptible to vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections.

It possesses a C-type lectin-like domain (CTLD) followed by a poorly characterized neck region coupled to a transmembrane region and short intracellular tail. The CTLD of DNGR-1 binds F-actin exposed by dead cell corpses and causes the receptor to signal and potentiate cross-presentation of dead cell-associated antigens by DCs. Here, we describe a conformational change that occurs in the neck region of DNGR-1 in a pH- and ionic strength-dependent manner and that controls cross-presentation of dead cell-associated antigens. We identify residues in the neck region that, when mutated, lock DNGR-1 in one of the two conformational states to potentiate cross-presentation. In contrast, we show that chimeric proteins in which the neck region of DNGR-1 is replaced by that of unrelated C-type lectin receptors fail to promote cross-presentation. Our results suggest that the neck region of DNGR-1 is an integral receptor component that senses receptor progression through the endocytic pathway and has evolved to maximize extraction of antigens from cell corpses, coupling DNGR-1 function to its cellular localization.",A pH- and ionic strength-dependent conformational change in the neck region regulates DNGR-1 function in dendritic cells.,The EMBO journal
27647876,"The kinetochore is an essential structure that mediates accurate chromosome segregation in mitosis and meiosis. While many of the kinetochore components have been identified, the mechanisms of kinetochore assembly remain elusive. Here, we identify a novel role for Snap29, an unconventional SNARE, in promoting kinetochore assembly during mitosis in Drosophila and human cells. Snap29 localizes to the outer kinetochore and prevents chromosome mis-segregation and the formation of cells with fragmented nuclei. Snap29 promotes accurate chromosome segregation by mediating the recruitment of Knl1 at the kinetochore and ensuring stable microtubule attachments. Correct Knl1 localization to kinetochore requires human or Drosophila Snap29, and is prevented by a Snap29 point mutant that blocks Snap29 release from SNARE fusion complexes. Such mutant causes ectopic Knl1 recruitment to trafficking compartments. We propose that part of the outer kinetochore is functionally similar to membrane fusion interfaces.",An essential step of kinetochore formation controlled by the SNARE protein Snap29.,The EMBO journal

Using in vivo cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) method, we discovered the DIS3L2-dependent cytoplasmic uridylome of human cells. We found a broad spectrum of uridylated RNAs including rRNAs, snRNAs, snoRNAs, tRNAs, vault, 7SL, Y RNAs, mRNAs, lncRNAs, and transcripts from pseudogenes. The unifying features of most of these identified RNAs are aberrant processing and the presence of stable secondary structures.

However, its potential oncogenic activity and regulatory mechanisms that control SOX9 protein stability are poorly understood. Here, we show that SOX9 is a substrate of FBW7, a tumor suppressor, and a SCF (SKP1/CUL1/F-box)-type ubiquitin ligase. FBW7 recognizes a conserved degron surrounding threonine 236 (T236) in SOX9 that is phosphorylated by GSK3 kinase and consequently degraded by SCF(FBW)(7alpha) Failure to degrade SOX9 promotes migration, metastasis, and treatment resistance in medulloblastoma, one of the most common childhood brain tumors. FBW7 is either mutated or downregulated in medulloblastoma, and in cases where FBW7 mRNA levels are low, SOX9 protein is significantly elevated and this phenotype is associated with metastasis at diagnosis and poor patient outcome. Transcriptional profiling of medulloblastoma cells expressing a degradation-resistant SOX9 mutant reveals activation of pro-metastatic genes and genes linked to cisplatin resistance. Finally, we show that pharmacological inhibition of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway activity destabilizes SOX9 in a GSK3/FBW7-dependent manner, rendering medulloblastoma cells sensitive to cytostatic treatment.",FBW7 suppression leads to SOX9 stabilization and increased malignancy in medulloblastoma.,The EMBO journal

While much has been learned on synaptic protein synthesis, little is known on the routes by which synaptic proteins are degraded. Here we systematically studied how inhibition of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) affects the degradation rates of thousands of neuronal and synaptic proteins. We identified a group of proteins, including several proteins related to glutamate receptor trafficking, whose degradation rates were significantly slowed by UPS inhibition. Unexpectedly, however, degradation rates of most synaptic proteins were not significantly affected. Interestingly, many of the differential effects of UPS inhibition were readily explained by a quantitative framework that considered known metabolic turnover rates for the same proteins. In contrast to the limited effects on protein degradation, UPS inhibition profoundly and preferentially suppressed the synthesis of a large number of synaptic proteins. Our findings point to the importance of the UPS in the degradation of certain synaptic proteins, yet indicate that under basal conditions most synaptic proteins might be degraded through alternative pathways.",The effects of proteasomal inhibition on synaptic proteostasis.,The EMBO journal

However, the mechanisms governing dynamic synapses in adult brain are still largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that in the cortex of adult amyloid precursor protein knockout (APP-KO) mice, spine formation and elimination were both reduced while overall spine density remained unaltered. When housed under environmental enrichment, APP-KO mice failed to respond with an increase in spine density. Spine morphology was also altered in the absence of APP The underlying mechanism of these spine abnormalities in APP-KO mice was ascribed to an impairment in D-serine homeostasis. Extracellular D-serine concentration was significantly reduced in APP-KO mice, coupled with an increase of total D-serine. Strikingly, chronic treatment with exogenous D-serine normalized D-serine homeostasis and restored the deficits of spine dynamics, adaptive plasticity, and morphology in APP-KO mice. The cognitive deficit observed in APP-KO mice was also rescued by D-serine treatment.

Recruitment to sites of NPC assembly is mediated by its ESCRT-II domain and the LAP2-emerin-MAN1 (LEM) family of integral inner nuclear membrane proteins, Heh1 and Heh2. We establish direct binding between Heh2 and the ""open"" forms of both Chm7 and the ESCRT-III, Snf7, and between Chm7 and Snf7. Interestingly, Chm7 is required for the viability of yeast strains where double membrane seals have been observed over defective NPCs; deletion of CHM7 in these strains leads to a loss of nuclear compartmentalization suggesting that the sealing of defective NPCs and nuclear envelope ruptures could proceed through similar mechanisms.",Chm7 and Heh1 collaborate to link nuclear pore complex quality control with nuclear envelope sealing.,The EMBO journal

Some OTOF mutations cause a mild elevation of auditory thresholds but strong impairment of speech perception. At elevated body temperature, hearing is lost.

In Otof(I515T/I515T) inner hair cells (IHCs), otoferlin levels are diminished by 65%, and synaptic vesicles are enlarged. Exocytosis during prolonged stimulation is strongly reduced. This indicates that otoferlin is critical for the reformation of properly sized and fusion-competent synaptic vesicles. Moreover, we found sustained exocytosis and sound encoding to scale with the amount of otoferlin at the plasma membrane. We identified a 20 amino acid motif including an RXR motif, presumably present in human but not in mouse otoferlin, which reduces the plasma membrane abundance of Ile515Thr-otoferlin.

By screening through all cortically expressed miRNAs in HeLa cells, we show that several members of the miR-34/449 family control mitotic duration and spindle rotation. Analysis of miR-34/449 knockout (KO) mouse embryos demonstrates significant spindle misorientation phenotypes in cortical progenitors, resulting in an excess of radial glia cells at the expense of intermediate progenitors and a significant delay in neurogenesis.

These T-cell-derived myeloid blasts retain expression of a defined set of T-cell transcription factors, creating a lymphoid epigenetic memory that confers growth and propagates myeloid/T-lymphoid plasticity. Based on these characteristics, we identified a correlating human leukemia cohort and revealed targeting of Jak2/Stat3 signaling as a therapeutic possibility.

By using quantitative fluorescence microscopy with co-cultured neurons, here we show that alpha-synuclein fibrils efficiently transfer from donor to acceptor cells through tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) inside lysosomal vesicles. Following transfer through TNTs, alpha-synuclein fibrils are able to seed soluble alpha-synuclein aggregation in the cytosol of acceptor cells. We propose that donor cells overloaded with alpha-synuclein aggregates in lysosomes dispose of this material by hijacking TNT-mediated intercellular trafficking.

One protein, insulin-like growth factor (Igf) binding-protein 1 (Igfbp1), potently promoted beta-cell regeneration by potentiating alpha- to beta-cell transdifferentiation. Using various inhibitors and activators of the Igf pathway, we show that Igfbp1 exerts its regenerative effect, at least partly, by inhibiting Igf signaling. Igfbp1's effect on transdifferentiation appears conserved across species: Treating mouse and human islets with recombinant IGFBP1 in vitro increased the number of cells co-expressing insulin and glucagon threefold. Moreover, a prospective human study showed that having high IGFBP1 levels reduces the risk of developing type-2 diabetes by more than 85%.

We named this mechanism Golgi membrane-associated degradation (GOMED) pathway. This process is driven by the disruption of PI(4)P-dependent anterograde trafficking from the Golgi, and it also exists in Atg5-deficient mammalian cells. Biologically, when an Atg5-deficient beta-cell line and Atg7-deficient beta-cells were cultured in glucose-deprived medium, a disruption in the secretion of insulin granules from the Golgi occurred, and GOMED was induced to digest these (pro)insulin granules.

NSUN3 specifically recognises the anticodon stem loop (ASL) of the tRNA, explaining why a mutation that compromises ASL basepairing leads to disease. We further identify ALKBH1/ABH1 as the dioxygenase responsible for oxidising m(5)C34 of mt-tRNA(M)(et) to generate an f(5)C34 modification. In vitro codon recognition studies with mitochondrial translation factors reveal preferential utilisation of m(5)C34 mt-tRNA(Met) in initiation.

Furthermore, under conditions of prolonged PI3K/Akt pathway inhibition, SGK3 substitutes for Akt by phosphorylating TSC2 to activate mTORC1. We characterise 14h, a compound that inhibits both SGK3 activity and activation in vivo, and show that a combination of Akt and SGK inhibitors induced marked regression of BT-474 breast cancer cell-derived tumours in a xenograft model. Finally, we present the kinome-wide analysis of mRNA expression dynamics induced by PI3K/Akt inhibition. Our findings highlight the importance of the hVps34-SGK3 pathway and suggest it represents a mechanism to counteract inhibition of PI3K/Akt signalling. The data support the potential of targeting both Akt and SGK as a cancer therapeutic.",The hVps34-SGK3 pathway alleviates sustained PI3K/Akt inhibition by stimulating mTORC1 and tumour growth.,The EMBO journal
27481934,"8-oxo-7,8-dihydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG) has high mutagenic potential as it is prone to mispair with deoxyadenine (dA). In order to maintain genomic integrity, post-replicative 8-oxo-dG:dA mispairs are removed through DNA polymerase lambda (Pol lambda)-dependent MUTYH-initiated base excision repair (BER). Here, we describe seven novel crystal structures and kinetic data that fully characterize 8-oxo-dG bypass by Pol lambda. We demonstrate that Pol lambda has a flexible active site that can tolerate 8-oxo-dG in either the anti- or syn-conformation. Importantly, we show that discrimination against the pro-mutagenic syn-conformation occurs at the extension step and identify the residue responsible for this selectivity. This residue acts as a kinetic switch, shunting repair toward long-patch BER upon correct dCMP incorporation, thus enhancing repair efficiency. Moreover, this switch also provides a potential mechanism to increase repair fidelity of MUTYH-initiated BER.",A fidelity mechanism in DNA polymerase lambda promotes error-free bypass of 8-oxo-dG.,The EMBO journal

Here, we demonstrate that otoferlin, a TA protein essential for hair cell exocytosis, is inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) via the TRC40 pathway. We mutated the TRC40 receptor tryptophan-rich basic protein (Wrb) in hair cells of zebrafish and mice and studied the impact of defective TA protein insertion. Wrb disruption reduced otoferlin levels in hair cells and impaired hearing, which could be restored in zebrafish by transgenic Wrb rescue and otoferlin overexpression. Wrb-deficient mouse inner hair cells (IHCs) displayed normal numbers of afferent synapses, Ca(2+) channels, and membrane-proximal vesicles, but contained fewer ribbon-associated vesicles. Patch-clamp of IHCs revealed impaired synaptic vesicle replenishment. In vivo recordings from postsynaptic spiral ganglion neurons showed a use-dependent reduction in sound-evoked spiking, corroborating the notion of impaired IHC vesicle replenishment. A human mutation affecting the transmembrane domain of otoferlin impaired its ER targeting and caused an auditory synaptopathy. We conclude that the TRC40 pathway is critical for hearing and propose that otoferlin is an essential substrate of this pathway in hair cells.",Tryptophan-rich basic protein (WRB) mediates insertion of the tail-anchored protein otoferlin and is required for hair cell exocytosis and hearing.,The EMBO journal

NMDA receptor (NMDAR) antagonists block c-Jun upregulation and prevent neuronal cell death following excitotoxic insults. However, the molecular mechanisms regulating c-Jun abundance in neurons are poorly understood. Here, we show that the synaptic component Proline rich 7 (PRR7) accumulates in the nucleus of hippocampal neurons following NMDAR activity. We find that PRR7 inhibits the ubiquitination of c-Jun by E3 ligase SCF(FBW) (7) (FBW7), increases c-Jun-dependent transcriptional activity, and promotes neuronal death. Microarray assays show that PRR7 abundance is directly correlated with transcripts associated with cellular viability. Moreover, PRR7 knockdown attenuates NMDAR-mediated excitotoxicity in neuronal cultures in a c-Jun-dependent manner. Our results show that PRR7 links NMDAR activity to c-Jun function and provide new insights into the molecular processes that underlie NMDAR-dependent excitotoxicity.",Synaptonuclear messenger PRR7 inhibits c-Jun ubiquitination and regulates NMDA-mediated excitotoxicity.,The EMBO journal

However, it is still unknown whether COPI vesicles fuse everywhere or at specific sites with the ER membrane. Taking advantage of the circumstance that the vesicles still carry their coat when they arrive at the ER, we have visualized active ER arrival sites (ERAS) by monitoring contact between COPI coat components and the ER-resident Dsl tethering complex using bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC). ERAS form punctate structures near Golgi compartments, clearly distinct from ER exit sites. Furthermore, ERAS are highly polarized in an actin and myosin V-dependent manner and are localized near hotspots of plasma membrane expansion. Genetic experiments suggest that the COPI*Dsl BiFC complexes recapitulate the physiological interaction between COPI and the Dsl complex and that COPI vesicles are mistargeted in dsl1 mutants.

Herein, we performed mtDNA next-generation sequencing (NGS) on 84 hiPSC clones derived from a cohort of 19 individuals, including mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial patients. The analysis of mtDNA variants showed that low levels of potentially pathogenic mutations in the original fibroblasts are revealed through nuclear reprogramming, generating mutant hiPSCs with a detrimental effect in their differentiated progeny. Specifically, hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes with expanded mtDNA mutations non-related with any described human disease, showed impaired mitochondrial respiration, being a potential cause of intra-person hiPSC variability.

27436874,"Cellular transitions require dramatic changes in gene expression that are supported by regulated mRNA decay and new transcription. The maternal-to-zygotic transition is a conserved developmental progression during which thousands of maternal mRNAs are cleared by post-transcriptional mechanisms. Although some maternal mRNAs are targeted for degradation by microRNAs, this pathway does not fully explain mRNA clearance. We investigated how codon identity and translation affect mRNA stability during development and homeostasis. We show that the codon triplet contains translation-dependent regulatory information that influences transcript decay. Codon composition shapes maternal mRNA clearance during the maternal-to-zygotic transition in zebrafish, Xenopus, mouse, and Drosophila, and gene expression during homeostasis across human tissues. Some synonymous codons show consistent stabilizing or destabilizing effects, suggesting that amino acid composition influences mRNA stability. Codon composition affects both polyadenylation status and translation efficiency. Thus, the ribosome interprets two codes within the mRNA: the genetic code which specifies the amino acid sequence and a conserved ""codon optimality code"" that shapes mRNA stability and translation efficiency across vertebrates.",Codon identity regulates mRNA stability and translation efficiency during the maternal-to-zygotic transition.,The EMBO journal

These caspases are activated within multi-protein inflammasome complexes that assemble in response to pathogens and endogenous danger signals. Pyroptotic cell death has been proposed to proceed via the formation of a plasma membrane pore, but the underlying molecular mechanism has remained unclear. Recently, gasdermin D (GSDMD), a member of the ill-characterized gasdermin protein family, was identified as a caspase substrate and an essential mediator of pyroptosis. GSDMD is thus a candidate for pyroptotic pore formation. Here, we characterize GSDMD function in live cells and in vitro We show that the N-terminal fragment of caspase-1-cleaved GSDMD rapidly targets the membrane fraction of macrophages and that it induces the formation of a plasma membrane pore. In vitro, the N-terminal fragment of caspase-1-cleaved recombinant GSDMD tightly binds liposomes and forms large permeability pores. Visualization of liposome-inserted GSDMD at nanometer resolution by cryo-electron and atomic force microscopy shows circular pores with variable ring diameters around 20 nm.

Here, we show that vesicle fusion can be suppressed by phosphorylation of core conserved residues inside the SNARE domain. We took a proteomics approach using a PKCB knockout mast cell model and found that the key mast cell secretory protein VAMP8 becomes phosphorylated by PKC at multiple residues in the SNARE domain. Our data suggest that VAMP8 phosphorylation reduces vesicle fusion in vitro and suppresses secretion in living cells, allowing vesicles to dock but preventing fusion with the plasma membrane. Markedly, we show that the phosphorylation motif is absent in all eukaryotic neuronal VAMPs, but present in all other VAMPs. Thus, phosphorylation of SNARE domains is a general mechanism to restrict how much cells secrete, opening the door for new therapeutic strategies for suppression of secretion.",Phosphorylation of residues inside the SNARE complex suppresses secretory vesicle fusion.,The EMBO journal
27390128,"Eukaryotic gene regulation is associated with changes in chromatin compaction that modulate access to DNA regulatory sequences relevant for transcriptional activation or repression. Although much is known about the mechanism of chromatin remodeling in hormonal gene activation, how repression is accomplished is much less understood. Here we report that in breast cancer cells, ligand-activated progesterone receptor (PR) is directly recruited to transcriptionally repressed genes involved in cell proliferation along with the kinases ERK1/2 and MSK1. PR recruits BRG1 associated with the HP1gamma-LSD1 complex repressor complex, which is further anchored via binding of HP1gamma to the H3K9me3 signal deposited by SUV39H2. In contrast to what is observed during gene activation, only BRG1 and not the BAF complex is recruited to repressed promoters, likely due to local enrichment of the pioneer factor FOXA1. BRG1 participates in gene repression by interacting with H1.2, facilitating its deposition and stabilizing nucleosome positioning around the transcription start site.

However, the interplay between mitochondria and autophagy upon cell death signalling remains unclear. The T-cell receptor pathway signals the so-called activation-induced cell death (AICD) essential for immune tolerance regulation. Here, we show that this apoptotic pathway requires the inhibition of macroautophagy. Protein kinase-A activation downstream of T-cell receptor signalling inhibits macroautophagy upon AICD induction. This leads to the accumulation of damaged mitochondria, which are fragmented, display remodelled cristae and release cytochrome c, thereby driving apoptosis. Autophagy-forced reactivation that clears the Parkin-decorated mitochondria is as effective in inhibiting apoptosis as genetic interference with cristae remodelling and cytochrome c release.

In these connected organelles, how some proteins concentrate specifically at the surface of LDs is not known. Here, we show that the ERAD ubiquitin ligase Doa10 controls the levels of some LD proteins. Their degradation is dependent on the localization to the ER and appears independent of the folding state. Moreover, we show that by degrading the ER pool of these LD proteins, ERAD contributes to restrict their localization to LDs. The signals for LD targeting and Doa10-mediated degradation overlap, indicating that these are competing events.

Mechanistically, PBX1 plays a dual role in transcription by directly repressing or activating genes, such as Onecut2 to inhibit lateral fates during embryogenesis, Pitx3 to promote mDAn development, and Nfe2l1 to protect from oxidative stress. Notably, PBX1 and NFE2L1 levels are severely reduced in dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and decreased NFE2L1 levels increases damage by oxidative stress in human midbrain cells.

In neuronal cells, INPP5E knockdown strongly inhibited autophagy by impairing the fusion step.

Furthermore, analysis of muscle Mfn2-deficient mice revealed that aging-induced Mfn2 decrease underlies the age-related alterations in metabolic homeostasis and sarcopenia. Mfn2 deficiency reduced autophagy and impaired mitochondrial quality, which contributed to an exacerbated age-related mitochondrial dysfunction. Interestingly, aging-induced Mfn2 deficiency triggers a ROS-dependent adaptive signaling pathway through induction of HIF1alpha transcription factor and BNIP3.

Mutations in the FUS gene were identified in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but the pathomechanisms by which these mutations cause ALS are not known. Here, we show that FUS interacts with the minor spliceosome constituent U11 snRNP, binds preferentially to minor introns and directly regulates their removal. Furthermore, a FUS knockout in neuroblastoma cells strongly disturbs the splicing of minor intron-containing mRNAs, among them mRNAs required for action potential transmission and for functional spinal motor units. Moreover, an ALS-associated FUS mutant that forms cytoplasmic aggregates inhibits splicing of minor introns by trapping U11 and U12 snRNAs in these aggregates. Collectively, our findings suggest a possible pathomechanism for ALS in which mutated FUS inhibits correct splicing of minor introns in mRNAs encoding proteins required for motor neuron survival.",Minor intron splicing is regulated by FUS and affected by ALS-associated FUS mutants.,The EMBO journal
27242363,"Accurate handling of stalled replication forks is crucial for the maintenance of genome stability. RAD51 defends stalled replication forks from nucleolytic attack, which otherwise can threaten genome stability. However, the identity of other factors that can collaborate with RAD51 in this task is poorly elucidated. Here, we establish that human Werner helicase interacting protein 1 (WRNIP1) is localized to stalled replication forks and cooperates with RAD51 to safeguard fork integrity. We show that WRNIP1 is directly involved in preventing uncontrolled MRE11-mediated degradation of stalled replication forks by promoting RAD51 stabilization on ssDNA We further demonstrate that replication fork protection does not require the ATPase activity of WRNIP1 that is however essential to achieve the recovery of perturbed replication forks. Loss of WRNIP1 or its catalytic activity causes extensive DNA damage and chromosomal aberrations. Intriguingly, downregulation of the anti-recombinase FBH1 can compensate for loss of WRNIP1 activity, since it attenuates replication fork degradation and chromosomal aberrations in WRNIP1-deficient cells. Therefore, these findings unveil a unique role for WRNIP1 as a replication fork-protective factor in maintaining genome stability.",WRNIP1 protects stalled forks from degradation and promotes fork restart after replication stress.,The EMBO journal

Macrophages have recently been proposed to be an essential source of IFN during viral infection. However, it is not known how HSV-1 inhibits IFN expression in this cell type. Here, we show that HSV-1 inhibits type I IFN induction through the cGAS-STING-TBK1 pathway in human macrophages, in a manner dependent on the conserved herpesvirus protein ICP27. This viral protein was expressed de novo in macrophages with early nuclear localization followed by later translocation to the cytoplasm where ICP27 prevented activation of IRF3. ICP27 interacted with TBK1 and STING in a manner that was dependent on TBK1 activity and the RGG motif in ICP27. Thus, HSV-1 inhibits expression of type I IFN in human macrophages through ICP27-dependent targeting of the TBK1-activated STING signalsome.",HSV-1 ICP27 targets the TBK1-activated STING signalsome to inhibit virus-induced type I IFN expression.,The EMBO journal
27234298,"Skp1-Cul1-F-box protein (SCF) ubiquitin ligases direct cell survival decisions by controlling protein ubiquitylation and degradation. Sufu (Suppressor of fused) is a central regulator of Hh (Hedgehog) signaling and acts as a tumor suppressor by maintaining the Gli (Glioma-associated oncogene homolog) transcription factors inactive. Although Sufu has a pivotal role in Hh signaling, the players involved in controlling Sufu levels and their role in tumor growth are unknown. Here, we show that Fbxl17 (F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 17) targets Sufu for proteolysis in the nucleus. The ubiquitylation of Sufu, mediated by Fbxl17, allows the release of Gli1 from Sufu for proper Hh signal transduction. Depletion of Fbxl17 leads to defective Hh signaling associated with an impaired cancer cell proliferation and medulloblastoma tumor growth. Furthermore, we identify a mutation in Sufu, occurring in medulloblastoma of patients with Gorlin syndrome, which increases Sufu turnover through Fbxl17-mediated polyubiquitylation and leads to a sustained Hh signaling activation. In summary, our findings reveal Fbxl17 as a novel regulator of Hh pathway and highlight the perturbation of the Fbxl17-Sufu axis in the pathogenesis of medulloblastoma.",SCF (Fbxl17) ubiquitylation of Sufu regulates Hedgehog signaling and medulloblastoma development.,The EMBO journal
27234297,"Ubiquitin and some of its homologues target proteins to the proteasome for degradation. Other ubiquitin-like domains are involved in cellular processes unrelated to the proteasome, and proteins containing these domains remain stable in the cell. We find that the 10 yeast ubiquitin-like domains tested bind to the proteasome, and that all 11 identified domains can target proteins for degradation. Their apparent proteasome affinities are not directly related to their stabilities or functions. That is, ubiquitin-like domains in proteins not part of the ubiquitin proteasome system may bind the proteasome more tightly than domains in proteins that are bona fide components. We propose that proteins with ubiquitin-like domains have properties other than proteasome binding that confer stability. We show that one of these properties is the absence of accessible disordered regions that allow the proteasome to initiate degradation. In support of this model, we find that Mdy2 is degraded in yeast when a disordered region in the protein becomes exposed and that the attachment of a disordered region to Ubp6 leads to its degradation.",Ubiquitin-like domains can target to the proteasome but proteolysis requires a disordered region.,The EMBO journal

Here, we report the crystal structure of Nap1 bound to H2A-H2B together with in vitro and in vivo functional studies that elucidate the principles underlying Nap1-mediated H2A-H2B chaperoning and nucleosome assembly. A Nap1 dimer provides an acidic binding surface and asymmetrically engages a single H2A-H2B heterodimer. Oligomerization of the Nap1-H2A-H2B complex results in burial of surfaces required for deposition of H2A-H2B into nucleosomes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-exonuclease (ChIP-exo) analysis shows that Nap1 is required for H2A-H2B deposition across the genome. Mutants that interfere with Nap1 oligomerization exhibit severe nucleosome assembly defects showing that oligomerization is essential for the chaperone function.

27225932,"Sirtuins, a family of protein deacetylases, promote cellular homeostasis by mediating communication between cells and environment. The enzymatic activity of the mammalian sirtuin SIRT7 targets acetylated lysine in the N-terminal tail of histone H3 (H3K18Ac), thus modulating chromatin structure and transcriptional competency. SIRT7 deletion is associated with reduced lifespan in mice through unknown mechanisms. Here, we show that SirT7-knockout mice suffer from partial embryonic lethality and a progeroid-like phenotype. Consistently, SIRT7-deficient cells display increased replication stress and impaired DNA repair. SIRT7 is recruited in a PARP1-dependent manner to sites of DNA damage, where it modulates H3K18Ac levels. H3K18Ac in turn affects recruitment of the damage response factor 53BP1 to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), thereby influencing the efficiency of non-homologous end joining (NHEJ).

27220849,"Membrane-less organelles in cells are large, dynamic protein/protein or protein/RNA assemblies that have been reported in some cases to have liquid droplet properties. However, the molecular interactions underlying the recruitment of components are not well understood. Herein, we study how the ability to form higher-order assemblies influences the recruitment of the speckle-type POZ protein (SPOP) to nuclear speckles. SPOP, a cullin-3-RING ubiquitin ligase (CRL3) substrate adaptor, self-associates into higher-order oligomers; that is, the number of monomers in an oligomer is broadly distributed and can be large. While wild-type SPOP localizes to liquid nuclear speckles, self-association-deficient SPOP mutants have a diffuse distribution in the nucleus. SPOP oligomerizes through its BTB and BACK domains. We show that BTB-mediated SPOP dimers form linear oligomers via BACK domain dimerization, and we determine the concentration-dependent populations of the resulting oligomeric species. Higher-order oligomerization of SPOP stimulates CRL3(SPOP) ubiquitination efficiency for its physiological substrate Gli3, suggesting that nuclear speckles are hotspots of ubiquitination. Dynamic, higher-order protein self-association may be a general mechanism to concentrate functional components in membrane-less cellular bodies.",Higher-order oligomerization promotes localization of SPOP to liquid nuclear speckles.,The EMBO journal
27220848,"Immunoglobulin diversification is driven by activation-induced deaminase (AID), which converts cytidine to uracil within the Ig variable (IgV) regions. Central to the recruitment of AID to the IgV genes are factors that regulate the generation of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), the enzymatic substrate of AID Here, we report that chicken DT40 cells lacking variant histone H3.3 exhibit reduced IgV sequence diversification. We show that this results from impairment of the ability of AID to access the IgV genes due to reduced formation of ssDNA during IgV transcription. Loss of H3.3 also diminishes IgV R-loop formation. However, reducing IgV R-loops by RNase HI overexpression in wild-type cells does not affect IgV diversification, showing that these structures are not necessary intermediates for AID access. Importantly, the reduction in the formation of AID-accessible ssDNA in cells lacking H3.3 is independent of any effect on the level of transcription or the kinetics of RNAPII elongation, suggesting the presence of H3.3 in the nucleosomes of the IgV genes increases the chances of the IgV DNA becoming single-stranded, thereby creating an effective AID substrate.",Histone H3.3 promotes IgV gene diversification by enhancing formation of AID-accessible single-stranded DNA.,The EMBO journal

Despite the availability of structural information on these proteases, it remains unclear how these enzymes bind and recruit substrates, particularly for the Alzheimer's disease-associated gamma-secretase. Systematically scanning amyloid precursor protein substrates containing a genetically inserted photocrosslinkable amino acid for binding to gamma-secretase allowed us to identify residues contacting the protease. These were primarily found in the transmembrane cleavage domain of the substrate and were also present in the extramembranous domains. The N-terminal fragment of the catalytic subunit presenilin was determined as principal substrate-binding site. Clinical presenilin mutations altered substrate binding in the active site region, implying a pathogenic mechanism for familial Alzheimer's disease. Remarkably, PEN-2 was identified besides nicastrin as additional substrate-binding subunit. Probing proteolysis of crosslinked substrates revealed a mechanistic model of how these subunits interact to mediate a stepwise transfer of bound substrate to the catalytic site.

However, regulation of Akt in cilia and its role in ciliary development has not been demonstrated. Using yeast two-hybrid screening, we demonstrate that Inversin (INVS) interacts with Akt. Mutation in the INVS gene causes nephronophthisis type II (NPHP2), an autosomal recessive chronic tubulointerstitial nephropathy. Co-immunoprecipitation assays show that Akt interacts with INVS via the C-terminus. In vitro kinase assays demonstrate that Akt phosphorylates INVS at amino acids 864-866 that are required not only for Akt interaction, but also for INVS dimerization. Co-localization of INVS and phosphorylated form of Akt at the basal body is augmented by PDGF-AA Akt-null MEF cells as well as siRNA-mediated inhibition of Akt attenuated ciliary growth, which was reversed by Akt reintroduction. Mutant phosphodead- or NPHP2-related truncated INVS, which lack Akt phosphorylation sites, suppress cell growth and exhibit distorted lumen formation and misalignment of spindle axis during cell division.

However, its presence in dendrites and dendritic spines is particularly relevant due to its involvement in synaptic plasticity and neurodegeneration. Here, we show that Tau plays a novel in vivo role in the morphological and synaptic maturation of newborn hippocampal granule neurons under basal conditions. Furthermore, we reveal that Tau is involved in the selective cell death of immature granule neurons caused by acute stress. Also, Tau deficiency protects newborn neurons from the stress-induced dendritic atrophy and loss of postsynaptic densities (PSDs). Strikingly, we also demonstrate that Tau regulates the increase in newborn neuron survival triggered by environmental enrichment (EE). Moreover, newborn granule neurons from Tau(-/-) mice did not show any stimulatory effect of EE on dendritic development or on PSD generation. Thus, our data demonstrate that Tau(-/-) mice show impairments in the maturation of newborn granule neurons under basal conditions and that they are insensitive to the modulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis exerted by both stimulatory and detrimental stimuli.",Novel function of Tau in regulating the effects of external stimuli on adult hippocampal neurogenesis.,The EMBO journal

The regrowth of corticospinal axons was enhanced in vivo with NB-3 deficiency or interruption of NB-3 trans-homophilic interactions. Biochemical, in vitro and in vivo evidence demonstrated that NB-3 homophilically interacted in trans to initiate a growth inhibitory signal transduction from scar-forming cells to neurons by modulating mTOR activity via CHL1 and PTPsigma.

27174643,"To sense and defend against oxidative stress, cells depend on signal transduction cascades involving redox-sensitive proteins. We previously identified SUMO (small ubiquitin-related modifier) enzymes as downstream effectors of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Hydrogen peroxide transiently inactivates SUMO E1 and E2 enzymes by inducing a disulfide bond between their catalytic cysteines. How important their oxidation is in light of many other redox-regulated proteins has however been unclear. To selectively disrupt this redox switch, we identified a catalytically fully active SUMO E2 enzyme variant (Ubc9 D100A) with strongly reduced propensity to maintain a disulfide with the E1 enzyme in vitro and in cells. Replacement of Ubc9 by this variant impairs cell survival both under acute and mild chronic oxidative stresses. Intriguingly, Ubc9 D100A cells fail to maintain activity of the ATM-Chk2 DNA damage response pathway that is induced by hydrogen peroxide. In line with this, these cells are also more sensitive to the ROS-producing chemotherapeutic drugs etoposide/Vp16 and Ara-C.

They are characterized by a conserved tripartite motif in their N-terminal portion which comprises a canonical RING domain, one or two B-box domains and a coiled-coil region that mediates ligase dimerization. Self-association via the coiled-coil has been suggested to be crucial for catalytic activity of TRIMs; however, the precise molecular mechanism underlying this observation remains elusive. Here, we provide a detailed characterization of the TRIM ligases TRIM25 and TRIM32 and show how their oligomeric state is linked to catalytic activity. The crystal structure of a complex between the TRIM25 RING domain and an ubiquitin-loaded E2 identifies the structural and mechanistic features that promote a closed E2~Ub conformation to activate the thioester for ubiquitin transfer allowing us to propose a model for the regulation of activity in the full-length protein.

We show here that a significant fraction of Rac1 is associated with Rab11-positive recycling endosomes. Moreover, the Rab11 effector FIP3 controls Rac1 intracellular localization and Rac1 targeting to the immunological synapse. FIP3 regulates, in a Rac1-dependent manner, key morphological events, like T-cell spreading and synapse symmetry. Finally, Rab11-/FIP3-mediated regulation is necessary for T-cell activation leading to cytokine production. Therefore, Rac1 endosomal traffic is key to regulate T-cell activation.",Rac1-Rab11-FIP3 regulatory hub coordinates vesicle traffic with actin remodeling and T-cell activation.,The EMBO journal
27145933,"In hypoxic cells, dysfunctional mitochondria are selectively removed by a specialized autophagic process called mitophagy. The ER-mitochondrial contact site (MAM) is essential for fission of mitochondria prior to engulfment, and the outer mitochondrial membrane protein FUNDC1 interacts with LC3 to recruit autophagosomes, but the mechanisms integrating these processes are poorly understood. Here, we describe a new pathway mediating mitochondrial fission and subsequent mitophagy under hypoxic conditions. FUNDC1 accumulates at the MAM by associating with the ER membrane protein calnexin. As mitophagy proceeds, FUNDC1/calnexin association attenuates and the exposed cytosolic loop of FUNDC1 interacts with DRP1 instead. DRP1 is thereby recruited to the MAM, and mitochondrial fission then occurs. Knockdown of FUNDC1, DRP1, or calnexin prevents fission and mitophagy under hypoxic conditions. Thus, FUNDC1 integrates mitochondrial fission and mitophagy at the interface of the MAM by working in concert with DRP1 and calnexin under hypoxic conditions in mammalian cells.",FUNDC1 regulates mitochondrial dynamics at the ER-mitochondrial contact site under hypoxic conditions.,The EMBO journal

This epigenetic asymmetry is established in the gametes and maintained after fertilization by unknown mechanisms. In this manuscript, we have addressed the key question whether parentally inherited differential DNA methylation affects de novo targeting of chromatin modifiers in the early endosperm. Our data reveal that polycomb-mediated H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) is preferentially localized to regions that are targeted by the DNA glycosylase DEMETER (DME), mechanistically linking DNA hypomethylation to imprinted gene expression. Our data furthermore suggest an absence of de novo DNA methylation in the early endosperm, providing an explanation how DME-mediated hypomethylation of the maternal genome is maintained after fertilization. Lastly, we show that paternal-specific H3K27me3-marked regions are located at pericentromeric regions, suggesting that H3K27me3 and DNA methylation are not necessarily exclusive marks at pericentromeric regions in the endosperm.",Parental epigenetic asymmetry of PRC2-mediated histone modifications in the Arabidopsis endosperm.,The EMBO journal

We found elevated expression of genes encoding leukocyte trafficking determinants in mouse RPE as a consequence of retinal glutamate intoxication or optic nerve crush (ONC). Blocking VCAM-1 after ONC interfered with monocyte infiltration into the retina and resulted in a local pro-inflammatory cytokine bias. Live imaging of the injured eye showed monocyte accumulation first in the RPE, and subsequently in the retina, and peripheral leukocytes formed close contact with the RPE Our findings further implied that the ocular milieu can confer monocytes a phenotype advantageous for neuroprotection.

27103070,"Agonist-triggered downregulation of beta-adrenergic receptors (ARs) constitutes vital negative feedback to prevent cellular overexcitation. Here, we report a novel downregulation of beta2AR signaling highly specific for Cav1.2. We find that beta2-AR binding to Cav1.2 residues 1923-1942 is required for beta-adrenergic regulation of Cav1.2. Despite the prominence of PKA-mediated phosphorylation of Cav1.2 S1928 within the newly identified beta2AR binding site, its physiological function has so far escaped identification. We show that phosphorylation of S1928 displaces the beta2AR from Cav1.2 upon beta-adrenergic stimulation rendering Cav1.2 refractory for several minutes from further beta-adrenergic stimulation. This effect is lost in S1928A knock-in mice. Although AMPARs are clustered at postsynaptic sites like Cav1.2, beta2AR association with and regulation of AMPARs do not show such dissociation. Accordingly, displacement of the beta2AR from Cav1.2 is a uniquely specific desensitization mechanism of Cav1.2 regulation by highly localized beta2AR/cAMP/PKA/S1928 signaling. The physiological implications of this mechanism are underscored by our finding that LTP induced by prolonged theta tetanus (PTT-LTP) depends on Cav1.2 and its regulation by channel-associated beta2AR.",Phosphorylation of Cav1.2 on S1928 uncouples the L-type Ca2+ channel from the beta2 adrenergic receptor.,The EMBO journal

Here, we found that C9ORF72 forms a complex with the WDR41 and SMCR8 proteins to act as a GDP/GTP exchange factor for RAB8a and RAB39b and to thereby control autophagic flux.

While depletion of C9ORF72 only has a partial deleterious effect on neuron survival, it synergizes with Ataxin-2 Q30x toxicity to induce motor neuron dysfunction and neuronal cell death.

Here, we reveal a presynaptic inhibitory pathway activated by extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) that mediates CB1R- and mGluR2/3-induced secretion inhibition. This pathway is triggered by a variety of events, from foot shock-induced stress to intense neuronal activity, and induces phosphorylation of the presynaptic protein Munc18-1. Mimicking constitutive phosphorylation of Munc18-1 results in a drastic decrease in synaptic transmission. ERK-mediated phosphorylation of Munc18-1 ultimately leads to degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Conversely, preventing ERK-dependent Munc18-1 phosphorylation increases synaptic strength. CB1R- and mGluR2/3-induced synaptic inhibition and depolarization-induced suppression of excitation (DSE) are reduced upon ERK/MEK pathway inhibition and further reduced when ERK-dependent Munc18-1 phosphorylation is blocked.

The MDI-Larp complex promotes the synthesis of a subset of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins by cytosolic ribosomes on the mitochondrial surface. MDI-Larp's targets include mtDNA replication factors, mitochondrial ribosomal proteins, and electron-transport chain subunits. Lack of MDI abolishes mtDNA replication in ovaries, which leads to mtDNA deficiency in mature eggs.

Large sequence variations in CCP domains explain the diverse C3b-binding patterns, with limited or no contribution of some individual domains, while all regulators show extensive contacts with C3b for the domains at the third site. A variation of ~100 degrees rotation around the longitudinal axis is observed for domains binding at the fourth site on C3b, without affecting the overall binding mode. The data suggest a common evolutionary origin for both inhibitory mechanisms, called decay acceleration and cofactor activity, with variable C3b binding through domains at sites ii, iii, and iv, and provide a framework for understanding RCA disease-related mutations and immune evasion.",Regulators of complement activity mediate inhibitory mechanisms through a common C3b-binding mode.,The EMBO journal

27009120,"miRNAs associate with Argonaute (AGO) proteins to silence the expression of mRNA targets by inhibiting translation and promoting deadenylation, decapping, and mRNA degradation. A current model for silencing suggests that AGOs mediate these effects through the sequential recruitment of GW182 proteins, the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex and the translational repressor and decapping activator DDX6. An alternative model posits that AGOs repress translation by interfering with eIF4A function during 43S ribosomal scanning and that this mechanism is independent of GW182 and the CCR4-NOT complex in Drosophila melanogaster Here, we show that miRNAs, AGOs, GW182, the CCR4-NOT complex, and DDX6/Me31B repress and degrade polyadenylated mRNA targets that are translated via scanning-independent mechanisms in both human and Dm cells. This and additional observations indicate a common mechanism used by these proteins and miRNAs to mediate silencing.

Beclin-1 (also known as Atg6 in yeast) is a core protein essential for autophagic initiation and other biological processes. The activity of Beclin-1 is tightly regulated by multiple post-translational modifications, including ubiquitination, yet the molecular mechanism underpinning its reversible deubiquitination remains poorly defined. Here, we identified ubiquitin-specific protease 19 (USP19) as a positive regulator of autophagy, but a negative regulator of type I interferon (IFN) signaling.USP19 stabilizes Beclin-1 by removing the K11-linked ubiquitin chains of Beclin-1 at lysine 437. Moreover, we foundthat USP19 negatively regulates type IIFNsignaling pathway, by blockingRIG-I-MAVSinteraction in a Beclin-1-dependent manner. Depletion of eitherUSP19 or Beclin-1 inhibits autophagic flux and promotes type IIFNsignaling as well as cellular antiviral immunity.

26988032,"Amino acids regulate TOR complex 1 (TORC1) via two counteracting mechanisms, one activating and one inactivating. The presence of amino acids causes TORC1 recruitment to lysosomes where TORC1 is activated by binding Rheb. How the absence of amino acids inactivates TORC1 is less well understood. Amino acid starvation recruits the TSC1/TSC2 complex to the vicinity of TORC1 to inhibit Rheb; however, the upstream mechanisms regulating TSC2 are not known. We identify here the eIF4A-containing eIF4F translation initiation complex as an upstream regulator of TSC2 in response to amino acid withdrawal in Drosophila We find that TORC1 and translation preinitiation complexes bind each other. Cells lacking eIF4F components retain elevated TORC1 activity upon amino acid removal. This effect is specific for eIF4F and not a general consequence of blocked translation. This study identifies specific components of the translation machinery as important mediators of TORC1 inactivation upon amino acid removal.",eIF4A inactivates TORC1 in response to amino acid starvation.,The EMBO journal
26968986,"Nanos proteins repress the expression of target mRNAs by recruiting effector complexes through non-conserved N-terminal regions. In vertebrates, Nanos proteins interact with the NOT1 subunit of the CCR4-NOT effector complex through a NOT1 interacting motif (NIM), which is absent in Nanos orthologs from several invertebrate species. Therefore, it has remained unclear whether the Nanos repressive mechanism is conserved and whether it also involves direct interactions with the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex in invertebrates. Here, we identify an effector domain (NED) that is necessary for the Drosophila melanogaster (Dm) Nanos to repress mRNA targets. The NED recruits the CCR4-NOT complex through multiple and redundant binding sites, including a central region that interacts with the NOT module, which comprises the C-terminal domains of NOT1-3. The crystal structure of the NED central region bound to the NOT module reveals an unanticipated bipartite binding interface that contacts NOT1 and NOT3 and is distinct from the NIM of vertebrate Nanos. Thus, despite the absence of sequence conservation, the N-terminal regions of Nanos proteins recruit CCR4-NOT to assemble analogous repressive complexes.",Distinct modes of recruitment of the CCR4-NOT complex by Drosophila and vertebrate Nanos.,The EMBO journal

A well-characterized PTM involves in the removal and re-ligation of the C-terminal tyrosine on alpha-tubulin, but the purpose of this tyrosination-detyrosination cycle remains elusive. Here, we examined the processive motility of mammalian dynein complexed with dynactin and BicD2 (DDB) on tyrosinated versus detyrosinated microtubules. Motility was decreased ~fourfold on detyrosinated microtubules, constituting the largest effect of a tubulin PTM on motor function observed to date. This preference is mediated by dynactin's microtubule-binding p150 subunit rather than dynein itself. Interestingly, on a bipartite microtubule consisting of tyrosinated and detyrosinated segments, DDB molecules that initiated movement on tyrosinated tubulin continued moving into the segment composed of detyrosinated tubulin. This result indicates that the alpha-tubulin tyrosine facilitates initial motor-tubulin encounters, but is not needed for subsequent motility. Our results reveal a strong effect of the C-terminal alpha-tubulin tyrosine on dynein-dynactin motility and suggest that the tubulin tyrosination cycle could modulate the initiation of dynein-driven motility in cells.",Tyrosination of alpha-tubulin controls the initiation of processive dynein-dynactin motility.,The EMBO journal

We found that Bob1 together with the octamer transcription factors Oct1/Oct2 can directly bind to and transactivate theBcl6andBtlapromoters. Mixed bone marrow chimeras revealed that Bob1 is required for the expression of normal levels of Bcl6 andBTLA, thereby controlling the pool size and composition of the Tfh compartment in a T cell-intrinsic manner.

26951610,"FUS is an RNA-binding protein involved in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Cytoplasmic FUS-containing aggregates are often associated with concomitant loss of nuclear FUS Whether loss of nuclear FUS function, gain of a cytoplasmic function, or a combination of both lead to neurodegeneration remains elusive. To address this question, we generated knockin mice expressing mislocalized cytoplasmic FUS and complete FUS knockout mice. Both mouse models display similar perinatal lethality with respiratory insufficiency, reduced body weight and length, and largely similar alterations in gene expression and mRNA splicing patterns, indicating that mislocalized FUS results in loss of its normal function. However, FUS knockin mice, but not FUS knockout mice, display reduced motor neuron numbers at birth, associated with enhanced motor neuron apoptosis, which can be rescued by cell-specific CRE-mediated expression of wild-type FUS within motor neurons. Together, our findings indicate that cytoplasmic FUS mislocalization not only leads to nuclear loss of function, but also triggers motor neuron death through a toxic gain of function within motor neurons.",Toxic gain of function from mutant FUS protein is crucial to trigger cell autonomous motor neuron loss.,The EMBO journal

Here, we describe mice lacking GEMC1 (GMNC), a protein with a similar domain organization as Multicilin that has been implicated in DNA replication control. We have found that GEMC1-deficient mice are growth impaired, develop hydrocephaly with a high penetrance, and are infertile, due to defects in the formation of MCCs in the brain, respiratory tract, and germline.

26929012,"Synaptic ribbons are large proteinaceous scaffolds at the active zone of ribbon synapses that are specialized for rapid sustained synaptic vesicles exocytosis. A single ribbon-specific protein is known, RIBEYE, suggesting that ribbons may be constructed from RIBEYE protein. RIBEYE knockdown in zebrafish, however, only reduced but did not eliminate ribbons, indicating a more ancillary role. Here, we show in mice that full deletion of RIBEYE abolishes all presynaptic ribbons in retina synapses. Using paired recordings in acute retina slices, we demonstrate that deletion of RIBEYE severely impaired fast and sustained neurotransmitter release at bipolar neuron/AII amacrine cell synapses and rendered spontaneous miniature release sensitive to the slow Ca(2+)-buffer EGTA, suggesting that synaptic ribbons mediate nano-domain coupling of Ca(2+) channels to synaptic vesicle exocytosis.

However, mechanisms ofNPCs maintenance remain unclear. Here, we report an unexpected role for the cilium inNPCs maintenance and identifyCPAPas a negative regulator of ciliary length independent of its role in centrosome biogenesis. At the onset of cilium disassembly,CPAPprovides a scaffold for the cilium disassembly complex (CDC), which includes Nde1, Aurora A, andOFD1, recruited to the ciliary base for timely cilium disassembly. In contrast, mutatedCPAPfails to localize at the ciliary base associated with inefficientCDCrecruitment, long cilia, retarded cilium disassembly, and delayed cell cycle re-entry leading to premature differentiation of patientiPS-derivedNPCs. AberrantCDCfunction also promotes premature differentiation ofNPCs in SeckeliPS-derived organoids.

26912724,"A key step of Wnt signaling activation is the recruitment of beta-catenin to the Wnt target-gene promoter in the nucleus, but its mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, we identified FoxM1 as a novel target of Wnt signaling, which is essential for beta-catenin/TCF4 transactivation. GSK3 phosphorylates FoxM1 on serine 474 which induces FoxM1 ubiquitination mediated by FBXW7. Wnt signaling activation inhibits FoxM1 phosphorylation by GSK3-Axin complex and leads to interaction between FoxM1 and deubiquitinating enzyme USP5, thereby deubiquitination and stabilization of FoxM1. FoxM1 accumulation in the nucleus promotes recruitment of beta-catenin to Wnt target-gene promoter and activates the Wnt signaling pathway by protecting the beta-catenin/TCF4 complex from ICAT inhibition. Subsequently, the USP5-FoxM1 axis abolishes the inhibitory effect of ICAT and is required for Wnt-mediated tumor cell proliferation. Therefore, Wnt-induced deubiquitination of FoxM1 represents a novel and critical mechanism for controlling canonical Wnt signaling and cell proliferation.",Wnt-induced deubiquitination FoxM1 ensures nucleus beta-catenin transactivation.,The EMBO journal
26912723,"The initiation of eukaryotic DNA replication requires the assembly of active CMG (Cdc45-MCM-GINS) helicases at replication origins by a set of conserved and essential firing factors.

Here we show that Sld3, previously shown to be an essential CDK and Rad53 substrate, is recruited to the inactive MCM double hexamer in a DDK-dependent manner. Sld3 binds specifically to DDK-phosphorylated peptides from two MCM subunits (Mcm4, 6) and then recruits Cdc45. MCM mutants that cannot bind Sld3 or Sld3 mutants that cannot bind phospho-MCM or Cdc45 do not support replication. Moreover, phosphomimicking mutants in Mcm4 and Mcm6 bind Sld3 without DDK and facilitate DDK-independent replication.

Here, we show that Stat3 increases the expression of mitochondrial-encoded transcripts and enhances oxidative metabolism. Chromatin immunoprecipitation reveals that Stat3 binds to the mitochondrial genome, consistent with direct transcriptional regulation. An engineered form of Stat3 that localizes predominantly to mitochondria is sufficient to support enhanced proliferation of ES cells, but not to maintain their undifferentiated phenotype. Furthermore, during reprogramming from primed to naive states of pluripotency, Stat3 similarly upregulates mitochondrial transcripts and facilitates metabolic resetting.

26903600,"Cohesion between sister chromatids is established during DNA replication but needs to be maintained to enable proper chromosome-spindle attachments in mitosis or meiosis. Cohesion is mediated by cohesin, but also depends on cohesin acetylation and sororin. Sororin contributes to cohesion by stabilizing cohesin on DNA. Sororin achieves this by inhibiting WAPL, which otherwise releases cohesin from DNA and destroys cohesion. Here we describe mouse models which enable the controlled depletion of sororin by gene deletion or auxin-induced degradation. We show that sororin is essential for embryonic development, cohesion maintenance, and proper chromosome segregation. We further show that the acetyltransferases ESCO1 and ESCO2 are essential for stabilizing cohesin on chromatin, that their only function in this process is to acetylate cohesin's SMC3 subunit, and that DNA replication is also required for stable cohesin-chromatin interactions. Unexpectedly, we find that sororin interacts dynamically with the cohesin complexes it stabilizes. This implies that sororin recruitment to cohesin does not depend on the DNA replication machinery or process itself, but on a property that cohesin acquires during cohesion establishment.",Sororin actively maintains sister chromatid cohesion.,The EMBO journal

Untranslated mRNA regions (UTRs) are key mediators of post-transcriptional regulation. Previous studies have predicted thousands of ORFs in 5'UTRs, the vast majority of which have unknown function.

Using high-resolution ribosome footprinting, we find that (i)uORFs are prevalent within vertebrate transcriptomes, (ii) the majority show signatures of active translation, and (iii)uORFs act as potent regulators of translation and RNA levels, with a similar magnitude to miRNAs. Reporter experiments reveal clear repression of downstream translation by uORFs/oORFs. uORF number, intercistronic distance, overlap with the CDS, and initiation context most strongly influence translation. Evolution has targeted these features to favor uORFs amenable to regulation over constitutively repressive uORFs/oORFs.

Here, we show that blocks to pseudouridylation at these positions reduce the efficiency of pre-mRNA splicing, leading to growth-deficient phenotypes. Restoration of pseudouridylation at these positions using designer snoRNAs results in near complete rescue of splicing and cell growth. These Psis interact genetically with Prp5, an RNA-dependent ATPase involved in monitoring the U2 BSRR-branch site base-pairing interaction. Biochemical analysis indicates that Prp5 has reduced affinity for U2 snRNA that lacks Psi42 and Psi44 and that Prp5 ATPase activity is reduced when stimulated by U2 lacking Psi42 or Psi44 relative to wild type, resulting in inefficient spliceosome assembly. Furthermore, in vivo DMS probing analysis reveals that pseudouridylated U2, compared to U2 lacking Psi42 and Psi44, adopts a slightly different structure in the branch site recognition region.

Selective perturbation of brain angiogenesis in vessel-specific Gpr124 null embryos, which prevented the relief from hypoxia, increased NSC expansion at the expense of differentiation. Conversely, exposure to increased oxygen levels rescued NSC differentiation in Gpr124 null embryos and increased it further in WT embryos, suggesting that niche blood vessels regulate NSC differentiation at least in part by providing oxygen.

In multiple models of senescence, absence of mitochondria reduced a spectrum of senescence effectors and phenotypes while preserving ATP production via enhanced glycolysis. Global transcriptomic analysis by RNA sequencing revealed that a vast number of senescent-associated changes are dependent on mitochondria, particularly the pro-inflammatory phenotype. Mechanistically, we show that the ATM, Akt and mTORC1 phosphorylation cascade integrates signals from the DNA damage response (DDR) towards PGC-1beta-dependent mitochondrial biogenesis, contributing to aROS-mediated activation of the DDR and cell cycle arrest.

Here, we identify that PAQR3 governs the preferential formation and activation of ATG14L-linked VPS34 complex for autophagy initiation via two levels of regulation. Firstly, PAQR3 functions as a scaffold protein that facilitates the formation of ATG14L- but not UVRAG-linked VPS34 complex, leading to elevated capacity of PI(3)P generation ahead of starvation signals. Secondly, AMPK phosphorylates PAQR3 at threonine 32 and switches on PI(3)P production to initiate autophagosome formation swiftly after glucose starvation. Deletion of PAQR3 leads to reduction of exercise-induced autophagy in mice, accompanied by a certain degree of disaggregation of ATG14L-associated VPS34 complex. Together, this study uncovers that PAQR3 can not only enhance the capacity of pro-autophagy class III PI3K due to its scaffold function, but also integrate AMPK signal to activation of ATG14L-linked VPS34 complex upon glucose starvation.",PAQR3 controls autophagy by integrating AMPK signaling to enhance ATG14L-associated PI3K activity.,The EMBO journal
26813791,"To reestablish homeostasis and mitigate stress, cells must activate a series of adaptive intracellular signaling pathways. The participation of the transcription factors TFEB and TFE3 in cellular adaptation to starvation is well established. Here, we show that TFEB and TFE3 also play an important role in the cellular response to ER stress. Treatment with ER stressors causes translocation of TFEB and TFE3 to the nucleus in a process that is dependent on PERK and calcineurin but not on mTORC1. Activated TFEB and TFE3 enhance cellular response to stress by inducing direct transcriptional upregulation of ATF4 and other UPR genes. Under conditions of prolonged ER stress, TFEB and TFE3 contribute to cell death, thus revealing an unexpected role for these proteins in controlling cell fate. This work evidences a broader role of TFEB and TFE3 in the cellular response to stress than previously anticipated and reveals an integrated cooperation between different cellular stress pathways.",TFEB and TFE3 are novel components of the integrated stress response.,The EMBO journal
26796577,"Immunological memory is a defining feature of vertebrate physiology, allowing rapid responses to repeat infections. However, the molecular mechanisms required for its establishment and maintenance remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrated that the first steps in the acquisition of T-cell memory occurred during the initial activation phase of naive T cells by an antigenic stimulus. This event initiated extensive chromatin remodeling that reprogrammed immune response genes toward a stably maintained primed state, prior to terminal differentiation. Activation induced the transcription factors NFAT and AP-1 which created thousands of new DNase I-hypersensitive sites (DHSs), enabling ETS-1 and RUNX1 recruitment to previously inaccessible sites. Significantly, these DHSs remained stable long after activation ceased, were preserved following replication, and were maintained in memory-phenotype cells. We show that primed DHSs maintain regions of active chromatin in the vicinity of inducible genes and enhancers that regulate immune responses. We suggest that this priming mechanism may contribute to immunological memory in T cells by facilitating the induction of nearby inducible regulatory elements in previously activated T cells.",Inducible chromatin priming is associated with the establishment of immunological memory in T cells.,The EMBO journal

They are specifically recruited to the target gene by associated factors, and as a result of their activity, they contribute in modulating cell identity and differentiation. Structural and biophysical approaches are broadening our knowledge on these processes, demonstrating that DNA, histone tails and histone surfaces can each function as distinct yet functionally interconnected anchoring points promoting nucleosome binding and modification. The mechanisms underlying nucleosome recognition have been described for many histone modifiers and related readers. Here, we review the recent literature on the structural organization of these nucleosome-associated proteins, the binding properties that drive nucleosome modification and the methodological advances in their analysis. The overarching conclusion is that besides acting on the same substrate (the nucleosome), each system functions through characteristic modes of action, which bring about specific biological functions in gene expression regulation.","Touch, act and go: landing and operating on nucleosomes.",The EMBO journal

During apoptosis, Bax translocates to the mitochondria and mediates the permeabilization of the outer membrane, thereby facilitating the release of pro-apoptotic proteins. Yet the mechanistic details of the Bax-induced membrane permeabilization have so far remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that activated Bax molecules, besides forming large and compact clusters, also assemble, potentially with other proteins including Bak, into ring-like structures in the mitochondrial outer membrane. STED nanoscopy indicates that the area enclosed by a Bax ring is devoid of mitochondrial outer membrane proteins such as Tom20, Tom22, and Sam50. This strongly supports the view that the Bax rings surround an opening required for mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP). Even though these Bax assemblies may be necessary for MOMP, we demonstrate that at least in Drp1 knockdown cells, these assemblies are not sufficient for full cytochrome c release. Together, our super-resolution data provide direct evidence in support of large Bax-delineated pores in the mitochondrial outer membrane as being crucial for Bax-mediated MOMP in cells.",Bax assembles into large ring-like structures remodeling the mitochondrial outer membrane in apoptosis.,The EMBO journal

Hydrogen-deuterium exchange coupled with mass spectrometry revealed global nucleotide- and membrane-binding-dependent conformational changes, as well as the existence of an allosteric relay element in the alpha2(S) helix of the dynamin stalk domain. As predicted from structural studies, FRET analyses detect large movements of the pleckstrin homology domain (PHD) from a 'closed' conformation docked near the stalk to an 'open' conformation able to interact with membranes. We engineered dynamin constructs locked in either the closed or open state by chemical cross-linking or deletion mutagenesis and showed that PHD movements function as a conformational switch to regulate dynamin self-assembly, membrane binding, and fission. This PHD conformational switch is impaired by a centronuclear myopathy-causing disease mutation, S619L, highlighting the physiological significance of its role in regulating dynamin function.

We show that active Bax clustered into a broad distribution of distinct architectures, including full rings, as well as linear and arc-shaped oligomeric assemblies that localized in discrete foci along mitochondria. Remarkably, both rings and arcs assemblies of Bax perforated the membrane, as revealed by atomic force microscopy in lipid bilayers.

Here, we show that human painful inflammatory exudates, displaying non-acidic pH, induce a slow constitutive activation of human ASIC3 channels. This effect is largely driven by lipids, and we identify lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) and arachidonic acid (AA) as endogenous activators of ASIC3 in the absence of any extracellular acidification. The combination of LPC and AA evokes robust depolarizing current in DRG neurons at physiological pH 7.4, increases nociceptive C-fiber firing, and induces pain behavior in rats, effects that are all prevented by ASIC3 blockers. Lipid-induced pain is also significantly reduced in ASIC3 knockout mice.

By integrating gene expression profiling, epigenomic footprinting, and loss-of-function experiments in PDAC cell lines of different grade, we identified the repertoires of enhancers specific to high- and low-grade PDACs and the cognate set of transcription factors acting to maintain their activity. Among the candidate regulators of PDAC differentiation, KLF5 was selectively expressed in pre-neoplastic lesions and low-grade primary PDACs and cell lines, where it maintained the acetylation of grade-specific enhancers, the expression of epithelial genes such as keratins and mucins, and the ability to organize glandular epithelia in xenografts.

While the majority of kinesin motors transport cargo selectively into axons, we identified five members of the kinesin-3 (KIF1) and kinesin-4 (KIF21) subfamily that can also target dendrites. We found that microtubule-binding protein doublecortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1) labels a subset of dendritic microtubules and is required for KIF1-dependent dense-core vesicles (DCVs) trafficking into dendrites and dendrite development.

The release of neuroactive substances from astrocytes occurs through several distinct pathways that include diffusion through plasmalemmal channels, translocation by multiple transporters and regulated exocytosis. As in other eukaryotic cells, exocytotic secretion from astrocytes involves divergent secretory organelles (synaptic-like microvesicles, dense-core vesicles, lysosomes, exosomes and ectosomes), which differ in size, origin, cargo, membrane composition, dynamics and functions.

While posttranslational modification has been demonstrated to regulate RIG-I signaling activity, its significance for the sensing of viral RNAs remains unclear. Here, we first show that the RIG-I C-terminal region undergoes deacetylation to regulate its viral RNA-sensing activity and that the HDAC6-mediated deacetylation of RIG-I is critical for viral RNA detection. HDAC6 transiently bound to RIG-I and removed the lysine 909 acetylation in the presence of viral RNAs, promoting RIG-I sensing of viral RNAs. Depletion of HDAC6 expression led to impaired antiviral responses against RNA viruses, but not against DNA viruses. Consequently, HDAC6 knockout mice were highly susceptible to RNA virus infections compared to wild-type mice.

The serine-threonine protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) deactivates this pathway whereas prolonging eIF2alpha phosphorylation enhances cell survival. Here, we show that the reactive oxygen species-generating NADPH oxidase-4 (Nox4) is induced downstream of ATF4, binds to a PP1-targeting subunit GADD34 at the endoplasmic reticulum, and inhibits PP1 activity to increase eIF2alpha phosphorylation and ATF4 levels. Other PP1 targets distant from the endoplasmic reticulum are unaffected, indicating a spatially confined inhibition of the phosphatase. PP1 inhibition involves metal center oxidation rather than the thiol oxidation that underlies redox inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphatases. We show that this Nox4-regulated pathway robustly enhances cell survival and has a physiologic role in heart ischemia-reperfusion and acute kidney injury.

In this study, we identify the TRAPP complex, a multi-subunit tethering complex and GEF for RAB1, as an interactor of TBC1D14. TBC1D14 binds to the TRAPP complex via an N-terminal 103 amino acid region, and overexpression of this region inhibits both autophagy and secretory traffic. TRAPPC8, the mammalian orthologue of a yeast autophagy-specific TRAPP subunit, forms part of a mammalian TRAPPIII-like complex and both this complex and TBC1D14 are needed for RAB1 activation. TRAPPC8 modulates autophagy and secretory trafficking and is required for TBC1D14 to bind TRAPPIII. Importantly, TBC1D14 and TRAPPIII regulate ATG9 trafficking independently of ULK1.

However, the mechanisms governing dynamic DNA methylation at CTCF-binding sites were unclear. Here, we reveal the methylcytosine dioxygenases TET1 and TET2 as active regulators of CTCF-mediated alternative splicing through conversion of 5-methylcytosine to its oxidation derivatives. 5-hydroxymethylcytosine and 5-carboxylcytosine are enriched at an intragenic CTCF-binding sites in the CD45 model gene and are associated with alternative exon inclusion. Reduced TET levels culminate in increased 5-methylcytosine, resulting in CTCF eviction and exon exclusion. In vitro analyses establish the oxidation derivatives are not sufficient to stimulate splicing, but efficiently promote CTCF association. We further show genomewide that reciprocal exchange of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine and 5-methylcytosine at downstream CTCF-binding sites is a general feature of alternative splicing in naive and activated CD4(+) T cells.

TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) was identified as a major component of disease pathogenesis in ALS, frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), and other neurodegenerative disease. Despite the fact that TDP-43 is a multi-functional protein involved in RNA processing and a large number of TDP-43 RNA targets have been discovered, the initial toxic effect and the pathogenic mechanism underlying TDP-43-linked neurodegeneration remain elusive. In this study, we found that loss of TDP-43 strongly induced a nuclear translocation of TFEB, the master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy, through targeting the mTORC1 key component raptor. This regulation in turn enhanced global gene expressions in the autophagy-lysosome pathway (ALP) and increased autophagosomal and lysosomal biogenesis. However, loss of TDP-43 also impaired the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes through dynactin 1 downregulation, leading to accumulation of immature autophagic vesicles and overwhelmed ALP function. Importantly, inhibition of mTORC1 signaling by rapamycin treatment aggravated the neurodegenerative phenotype in a TDP-43-depleted Drosophila model, whereas activation of mTORC1 signaling by PA treatment ameliorated the neurodegenerative phenotype.

We demonstrate that in the absence of thrombopoietin (TPO), tyrosine-unphosphorylated STAT5 (uSTAT5) is present in the nucleus where it colocalizes with CTCF and represses a megakaryocytic transcriptional program. TPO-mediated phosphorylation of STAT5 triggers its genome-wide relocation to STAT consensus sites with two distinct transcriptional consequences, loss of a uSTAT5 program that restrains megakaryocytic differentiation and activation of a canonical pSTAT5-driven program which includes regulators of apoptosis and proliferation.

However, after the alpha5 helix was released into the MOM, the remaining interface with alpha2, alpha3, and alpha4 helices was rearranged. Another dimer interface was formed inside the MOM by two intersected or parallel alpha9 helices. Combinations of these interfaces generated oligomers in the MOM. Oligomerization was initiated by BH3-in-groove dimerization, without which neither the other dimerizations nor MOMP occurred. In contrast, alpha9 dimerization occurred downstream and was required for release of large but not small proteins from mitochondria.

We find that downstream of GSK3 inhibition, elevated cMyc and beta-catenin act in parallel to reduce transcription and DNA binding, respectively, of the transcriptional repressor Tcf7l1. Tcf7l1 represses FoxA2, a pioneer factor for endoderm specification. Deletion of Tcf7l1 is sufficient to allow upregulation of FoxA2 in the presence of Activin. In wild-type cells, cMyc contributes by reducing Tcf7l1 mRNA, while beta-catenin acts on Tcf7l1 protein.

HS memory is associated with the accumulation of histone H3 lysine 4 di- and trimethylation at memory-related loci. This accumulation outlasts their transcriptional activity and marks them as recently transcriptionally active. High accumulation of H3K4 methylation is associated with hyper-induction of gene expression upon a recurring HS. This transcriptional memory and the sustained accumulation of H3K4 methylation depend on HSFA2, a transcription factor that is required for HS memory, but not initial heat responses. Interestingly, HSFA2 associates with memory-related loci transiently during the early stages following HS.

Consistent with this, BRPF3 is necessary for H3K14ac at selected origins and efficient origin activation.

26612827,"Multiple sclerosis is the most frequent chronic inflammatory disease of the CNS. The entry and survival of pathogenic T cells in the CNS are crucial for the initiation and persistence of autoimmune neuroinflammation. In this respect, contradictory evidence exists on the role of the most potent type of antigen-presenting cells, dendritic cells. Applying intravital two-photon microscopy, we demonstrate the gatekeeper function of CNS professional antigen-presenting CD11c(+) cells, which preferentially interact with Th17 cells. IL-17 expression correlates with expression of GM-CSF by T cells and with accumulation of CNS CD11c(+) cells. These CD11c(+) cells are organized in perivascular clusters, targeted by T cells, and strongly express the inflammatory chemokines Ccl5, Cxcl9, and Cxcl10. Our findings demonstrate a fundamental role of CNS CD11c(+) cells in the attraction of pathogenic T cells into and their survival within the CNS. Depletion of CD11c(+) cells markedly reduced disease severity due to impaired enrichment of pathogenic T cells within the CNS.",Gatekeeper role of brain antigen-presenting CD11c+ cells in neuroinflammation.,The EMBO journal
26604301,"Internal ribosomal entry sites (IRESs) are structured cis-acting RNAs that drive an alternative, cap-independent translation initiation pathway. They are used by many viruses to hijack the translational machinery of the host cell. IRESs facilitate translation initiation by recruiting and actively manipulating the eukaryotic ribosome using only a subset of canonical initiation factor and IRES transacting factors. Here we present cryo-EM reconstructions of the ribosome 80S- and 40S-bound Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) IRES. The presence of four subpopulations for the 80S*HCV IRES complex reveals dynamic conformational modes of the complex. At a global resolution of 3.9 A for the most stable complex, a derived atomic model reveals a complex fold of the IRES RNA and molecular details of its interaction with the ribosome. The comparison of obtained structures explains how a modular architecture facilitates mRNA loading and tRNA binding to the P-site. This information provides the structural foundation for understanding the mechanism of HCV IRES RNA-driven translation initiation.",Molecular architecture of the ribosome-bound Hepatitis C Virus internal ribosomal entry site RNA.,The EMBO journal
26598532,"Hypoxia is an intensively investigated condition with profound effects on cell metabolism, migration, and angiogenesis during development and disease. Physiologically, hypoxia is linked to tissue homeostasis and maintenance of pluripotency. Hypoxia also contributes to pathologies including cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Despite its importance, microscopic visualization of hypoxia is largely restricted to the detection of reductively activated probes by immunostaining. Here, we describe a novel family of genetically encoded fluorescent sensors that detect the activation of HIF transcription factors reported by the oxygen-independent fluorescent protein UnaG. It comprises sensors with different switching and memory behavior and combination sensors that allow the distinction of hypoxic and reoxygenated cells. We tested these sensors on orthotopically transplanted glioma cell lines. Using a cranial window, we could visualize hypoxia intravitally at cellular resolution. In tissue samples, sensor activity was detected in regions, which were largely devoid of blood vessels, correlated with HIF-1alpha stabilization, and were highly heterogeneous at a cellular level. Frequently, we detected recently reoxygenated cells outside hypoxic areas in the proximity of blood vessels, suggestive of hypoxia-promoted cell migration.",A novel family of fluorescent hypoxia sensors reveal strong heterogeneity in tumor hypoxia at the cellular level.,The EMBO journal

Currently, it is accepted that a stereotyped distribution of cellular polygons is conserved in proliferating tissues among metazoans. In this work, we challenge these previous findings showing that diverse natural packed tissues have very different polygon distributions. We use Voronoi tessellations as a mathematical framework that predicts this diversity. We demonstrate that Voronoi tessellations and the very different tissues analysed share an overriding restriction: the frequency of polygon types correlates with the distribution of cell areas. By altering the balance of tensions and pressures within the packed tissues using disease, genetic or computer model perturbations, we show that as long as packed cells present a balance of forces within tissue, they will be under a physical constraint that limits its organization. Our discoveries establish a new framework to understand tissue architecture in development and disease.",Fundamental physical cellular constraints drive self-organization of tissues.,The EMBO journal

While the general morphology of the B complex is known, the spatial arrangement of proteins and snRNP subunits within it remain to be elucidated. To shed light on the architecture of the yeast B complex, we immuno-labelled selected proteins and located them by negative-stain electron microscopy. The B complex exhibited a triangular shape with main body, head and neck domains. We located the U5 snRNP components Brr2 at the top and Prp8 and Snu114 in the centre of the main body. We found several U2 SF3a (Prp9 and Prp11) and SF3b (Hsh155 and Cus1) proteins in the head domain and two U4/U6 snRNP proteins (Prp3 and Lsm4) in the neck domain that connects the main body with the head.

26574534,"Pathogens infect a host by suppressing defense responses induced upon recognition of microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs). Despite this suppression, MAMP receptors mediate basal resistance to limit host susceptibility, via a process that is poorly understood. The Arabidopsis leucine-rich repeat (LRR) receptor kinase BAK1 associates and functions with different cell surface LRR receptors for a wide range of ligands, including MAMPs. We report that BAK1 depletion is linked to defense activation through the endogenous PROPEP peptides (Pep epitopes) and their LRR receptor kinases PEPR1/PEPR2, despite critical defects in MAMP signaling. In bak1-knockout plants, PEPR elicitation results in extensive cell death and the prioritization of salicylate-based defenses over jasmonate-based defenses, in addition to elevated proligand and receptor accumulation. BAK1 disruption stimulates the release of PROPEP3, produced in response to Pep application and during pathogen challenge, and renders PEPRs necessary for basal resistance. These findings are biologically relevant, since specific BAK1 depletion coincides with PEPR-dependent resistance to the fungal pathogen Colletotrichum higginsianum. Thus, the PEPR pathway ensures basal resistance when MAMP-triggered defenses are compromised by BAK1 depletion.",Danger peptide receptor signaling in plants ensures basal immunity upon pathogen-induced depletion of BAK1.,The EMBO journal

A prion-like mechanism has been suggested: misfolded tau propagating through the brain seeds neurotoxic aggregation of soluble tau in recipient neurons. We use transgenic mice and viral tau expression to test the hypotheses that trans-synaptic tau propagation, aggregation, and toxicity rely on the presence of endogenous soluble tau. Surprisingly, mice expressing human P301Ltau in the entorhinal cortex showed equivalent tau propagation and accumulation in recipient neurons even in the absence of endogenous tau. We then tested whether the lack of endogenous tau protects against misfolded tau aggregation and toxicity, a second prion model paradigm for tau, using P301Ltau-overexpressing mice with severe tangle pathology and neurodegeneration. Crossed onto tau-null background, these mice had similar tangle numbers but were protected against neurotoxicity. Therefore, misfolded tau can propagate across neural systems without requisite templated misfolding, but the absence of endogenous tau markedly blunts toxicity. These results show that tau does not strictly classify as a prion protein.",Removing endogenous tau does not prevent tau propagation yet reduces its neurotoxicity.,The EMBO journal
26530471,"Although platinum-based drugs are widely used chemotherapeutics for cancer treatment, the determinants of tumor cell responsiveness remain poorly understood. We show that the loss of subunits LRRC8A and LRRC8D of the heteromeric LRRC8 volume-regulated anion channels (VRACs) increased resistance to clinically relevant cisplatin/carboplatin concentrations. Under isotonic conditions, about 50% of cisplatin uptake depended on LRRC8A and LRRC8D, but neither on LRRC8C nor on LRRC8E. Cell swelling strongly enhanced LRRC8-dependent cisplatin uptake, bolstering the notion that cisplatin enters cells through VRAC. LRRC8A disruption also suppressed drug-induced apoptosis independently from drug uptake, possibly by impairing VRAC-dependent apoptotic cell volume decrease. Hence, by mediating cisplatin uptake and facilitating apoptosis, VRAC plays a dual role in the cellular drug response. Incorporation of the LRRC8D subunit into VRAC substantially increased its permeability for cisplatin and the cellular osmolyte taurine, indicating that LRRC8 proteins form the channel pore. Our work suggests that LRRC8D-containing VRACs are crucial for cell volume regulation by an important organic osmolyte and may influence cisplatin/carboplatin responsiveness of tumors.",Subunit composition of VRAC channels determines substrate specificity and cellular resistance to Pt-based anti-cancer drugs.,The EMBO journal
26516211,"Cell fate specification relies on the action of critical transcription factors that become available at distinct stages of embryonic development. One such factor is NeuroD1, which is essential for eliciting the neuronal development program and possesses the ability to reprogram other cell types into neurons. Given this capacity, it is important to understand its targets and the mechanism underlying neuronal specification. Here, we show that NeuroD1 directly binds regulatory elements of neuronal genes that are developmentally silenced by epigenetic mechanisms. This targeting is sufficient to initiate events that confer transcriptional competence, including reprogramming of transcription factor landscape, conversion of heterochromatin to euchromatin, and increased chromatin accessibility, indicating potential pioneer factor ability of NeuroD1. The transcriptional induction of neuronal fate genes is maintained via epigenetic memory despite a transient NeuroD1 induction during neurogenesis. NeuroD1 also induces genes involved in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, thereby promoting neuronal migration. Our study not only reveals the NeuroD1-dependent gene regulatory program driving neurogenesis but also increases our understanding of how cell fate specification during development involves a concerted action of transcription factors and epigenetic mechanisms.",NeuroD1 reprograms chromatin and transcription factor landscapes to induce the neuronal program.,The EMBO journal

Moreover, novel lncRNAs and new classes of RNAs are being discovered at growing pace, suggesting that this class of molecules may have functions as diverse as protein-coding genes. Interestingly, the brain is the organ where lncRNAs have the most peculiar features including the highest number of lncRNAs that are expressed, proportion of tissue-specific lncRNAs and highest signals of evolutionary conservation.

In human cytomegalovirus, the complex consists of two proteins, UL50 and UL53. We solved structures of versions of UL53 and the complex by X-ray crystallography. The UL53 structures, determined at 1.93 and 3.0 A resolution, contained unexpected features including a Bergerat fold resembling that found in certain nucleotide-binding proteins, and a Cys3His zinc finger. Substitutions of zinc-coordinating residues decreased UL50-UL53 co-localization in transfected cells, and, when incorporated into the HCMV genome, ablated viral replication. The structure of the complex, determined at 2.47 A resolution, revealed a mechanism of heterodimerization in which UL50 clamps onto helices of UL53 like a vise. Substitutions of particular residues on the interaction interface disrupted UL50-UL53 co-localization in transfected cells and abolished virus production.

Earlier, we discovered that the herpesvirus nuclear egress complex (NEC) could bud synthetic membranes in vitro without the help of other proteins by forming a coat-like hexagonal scaffold inside the budding membrane. To understand the structural basis of NEC-mediated membrane budding, we determined the crystal structures of the NEC from two herpesviruses. The hexagonal lattice observed in the NEC crystals recapitulates the honeycomb coats within the budded vesicles. Perturbation of the oligomeric interfaces through mutagenesis blocks budding in vitro confirming that NEC oligomerization into a honeycomb lattice drives budding.

Here, we show that EglN2 depletion decreases mitochondrial respiration in breast cancer under normoxia and hypoxia, which correlates with decreased mitochondrial DNA in a HIF1/2alpha-independent manner. Integrative analyses of gene expression profile and genomewide binding of EglN2 under hypoxic conditions reveal nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1) motif enrichment in EglN2-activated genes, suggesting NRF1 as an EglN2 binding partner. Mechanistically, by forming an activator complex with PGC1alpha and NRF1 on chromatin, EglN2 promotes the transcription of ferridoxin reductase (FDXR) and maintains mitochondrial function.

26489954,"The complement system is an essential element of the innate immune response that becomes activated upon recognition of molecular patterns associated with microorganisms, abnormal host cells, and modified molecules in the extracellular environment. The resulting proteolytic cascade tags the complement activator for elimination and elicits a pro-inflammatory response leading to recruitment and activation of immune cells from both the innate and adaptive branches of the immune system. Through these activities, complement functions in the first line of defense against pathogens but also contributes significantly to the maintenance of homeostasis and prevention of autoimmunity. Activation of complement and the subsequent biological responses occur primarily in the extracellular environment. However, recent studies have demonstrated autocrine signaling by complement activation in intracellular vesicles, while the presence of a cytoplasmic receptor serves to detect complement-opsonized intracellular pathogens. Furthermore, breakthroughs in both functional and structural studies now make it possible to describe many of the intricate molecular mechanisms underlying complement activation and the subsequent downstream events, as well as its cross talk with, for example, signaling pathways, the coagulation system, and adaptive immunity. We present an integrated and updated view of complement based on structural and functional data and describe the new roles attributed to complement.

We have previously reported that PINK1 is activated by mitochondrial depolarisation and phosphorylates serine 65 (Ser(65)) of the ubiquitin ligase Parkin and ubiquitin to stimulate Parkin E3 ligase activity. Here, we have employed quantitative phosphoproteomics to search for novel PINK1-dependent phosphorylation targets in HEK (human embryonic kidney) 293 cells stimulated by mitochondrial depolarisation. This led to the identification of 14,213 phosphosites from 4,499 gene products. Whilst most phosphosites were unaffected, we strikingly observed three members of a sub-family of Rab GTPases namely Rab8A, 8B and 13 that are all phosphorylated at the highly conserved residue of serine 111 (Ser(111)) in response to PINK1 activation. Using phospho-specific antibodies raised against Ser(111) of each of the Rabs, we demonstrate that Rab Ser(111) phosphorylation occurs specifically in response to PINK1 activation and is abolished in HeLa PINK1 knockout cells and mutant PINK1 PD patient-derived fibroblasts stimulated by mitochondrial depolarisation. We provide evidence that Rab8A GTPase Ser(111) phosphorylation is not directly regulated by PINK1 in vitro and demonstrate in cells the time course of Ser(111) phosphorylation of Rab8A, 8B and 13 is markedly delayed compared to phosphorylation of Parkin at Ser(65). We further show mechanistically that phosphorylation at Ser(111) significantly impairs Rab8A activation by its cognate guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), Rabin8 (by using the Ser111Glu phosphorylation mimic). These findings provide the first evidence that PINK1 is able to regulate the phosphorylation of Rab GTPases and indicate that monitoring phosphorylation of Rab8A/8B/13 at Ser(111) may represent novel biomarkers of PINK1 activity in vivo.

The p97 complex is able to directly bind both non-ubiquitinated RIG-I and the E3 ligase RNF125, promoting K48-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I at residue K181. Viral infection significantly strengthens the interaction between RIG-I and the p97 complex by a conformational change of RIG-I that exposes the CARDs and through K63-linked ubiquitination of these CARDs.

Indeed, we find that tRNA processing defects lead to increased replication stress and de-repression of transposable elements in mutant ovaries.

We show that hair cell-specific disruption of AP-2mu slows IHC exocytosis immediately after fusion of the readily releasable pool of vesicles, despite normal abundance of membrane-proximal vesicles and intact endocytic membrane retrieval. Sound-driven postsynaptic spiking was reduced in a use-dependent manner, and the altered interspike interval statistics suggested a slowed reloading of release sites. Sustained strong stimulation led to accumulation of endosome-like vacuoles, fewer clathrin-coated endocytic intermediates, and vesicle depletion of the membrane-distal synaptic ribbon in AP-2mu-deficient IHCs, indicating a further role of AP-2mu in clathrin-dependent vesicle reformation on a timescale of many seconds. Finally, we show that AP-2 sorts its IHC-cargo otoferlin.

Surprisingly, a mutation that compromises NSMCE2-dependent SUMOylation does not have a detectable impact on murine lifespan. In contrast, NSMCE2 deletion in adult mice leads to pathologies resembling those found in patients of BS.

However, adult neurogenesis is compromised after brain injury in favor of a glial cell fate, which is mainly attributed to changes in the NSPC environment. Yet, it is unknown how this unfavorable extracellular environment translates into a transcriptional program altering NSPC differentiation. Here, we show that genetic depletion of the transcriptional regulator Id3 decreased the number of astrocytes generated from SVZ-derived adult NSPCs in the cortical lesion area after traumatic brain injury. Cortical brain injury resulted in rapid BMP-2 and Id3 up-regulation in the SVZ stem cell niche. Id3(-/-) adult NSPCs failed to differentiate into BMP-2-induced astrocytes, while NSPCs deficient for the Id3-controlled transcription factor E47 readily differentiated into astrocytes in the absence of BMP-2. Mechanistically, E47 repressed the expression of several astrocyte-specific genes in adult NSPCs.

Under mitophagy-inducing conditions, cells lacking Opi3 exhibit retardation of Cho2 repression that causes an anomalous increase in glutathione levels, leading to suppression of Atg32, a mitochondria-anchored protein essential for mitophagy. In addition, loss of Opi3 results in accumulation of phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine (PMME) and, surprisingly, generation of Atg8-PMME, a mitophagy-incompetent lipid conjugate of the autophagy-related ubiquitin-like modifier. Amelioration of Atg32 expression and attenuation of Atg8-PMME conjugation markedly rescue mitophagy in opi3-null cells. We propose that proper regulation of phospholipid methylation is crucial for Atg32-mediated mitophagy.",Phospholipid methylation controls Atg32-mediated mitophagy and Atg8 recycling.,The EMBO journal

However, the precise brain areas and circuit mechanisms connecting these social behaviors are largely unknown. Here we demonstrated that the c-Fos expression pattern in the four nuclei of the preoptic-bed nuclei of stria terminalis (BST) region could robustly discriminate five kinds of previous social behavior of male mice (parenting, infanticide, mating, inter-male aggression, solitary control). Specifically, neuronal activation in the central part of the medial preoptic area (cMPOA) and rhomboid nucleus of the BST (BSTrh) retroactively detected paternal and infanticidal motivation with more than 95% accuracy. Moreover, cMPOA lesions switched behavior in fathers from paternal to infanticidal, while BSTrh lesions inhibited infanticide in virgin males. The projections from cMPOA to BSTrh were largely GABAergic. Optogenetic or pharmacogenetic activation of cMPOA attenuated infanticide in virgin males. Taken together, this study identifies the preoptic-BST nuclei underlying social motivations in male mice and reveals unexpected complexity in the circuit connecting these nuclei.",Distinct preoptic-BST nuclei dissociate paternal and infanticidal behavior in mice.,The EMBO journal

How this ""ciliary gate"" assembles and functions remains largely unknown. Contrary to current models, we present evidence that Caenorhabditis elegans MKS-5 (orthologue of mammalian Mks5/Rpgrip1L/Nphp8 and Rpgrip1) may not be a simple structural scaffold for anchoring > 10 different proteins at the TZ, but instead, functions as an assembly factor. This activity is needed to form TZ ultrastructure, which comprises Y-shaped axoneme-to-membrane connectors. Coiled-coil and C2 domains within MKS-5 enable TZ localisation and functional interactions with two TZ modules, consisting of Meckel syndrome (MKS) and nephronophthisis (NPHP) proteins. Discrete roles for these modules at basal body-associated transition fibres and TZ explain their redundant functions in making essential membrane connections and thus sealing the ciliary compartment. Furthermore, MKS-5 establishes a ciliary zone of exclusion (CIZE) at the TZ that confines signalling proteins, including GPCRs and NPHP-2/inversin, to distal ciliary subdomains. The TZ/CIZE, potentially acting as a lipid gate, limits the abundance of the phosphoinositide PIP2 within cilia and is required for cell signalling. Together, our findings suggest a new model for Mks5/Rpgrip1L in TZ assembly and function that is essential for establishing the ciliary signalling compartment.",Formation of the transition zone by Mks5/Rpgrip1L establishes a ciliary zone of exclusion (CIZE) that compartmentalises ciliary signalling proteins and controls PIP2 ciliary abundance.,The EMBO journal

We find that Hfq has at least two distinct ways in which it interacts with sRNAs; these different binding properties have strong effects on the stability of the sRNA in vivo and the sequence requirements of regulated mRNAs. Class I sRNAs depend on proximal and rim Hfq sites for stability and turn over rapidly. Class II sRNAs are more stable and depend on the proximal and distal Hfq sites for stabilization. Using deletions and chimeras, we find that while Class I sRNAs regulate mRNA targets with previously defined ARN repeats, Class II sRNAs regulate mRNAs carrying UA-rich rim-binding sites. We discuss how these different binding modes may correlate with different roles in the cell, with Class I sRNAs acting as emergency responders and Class II sRNAs acting as silencers.",Alternative Hfq-sRNA interaction modes dictate alternative mRNA recognition.,The EMBO journal

However, the stoichiometry of acetylation has not been studied and is important for understanding whether SIRT3 regulates or suppresses acetylation. Using quantitative mass spectrometry, we measured acetylation stoichiometry in mouse liver tissue and found that SIRT3 suppressed acetylation to a very low stoichiometry at its target sites. By examining acetylation changes in the liver, heart, brain, and brown adipose tissue of fasted mice, we found that SIRT3-targeted sites were mostly unaffected by fasting, a dietary manipulation that is thought to regulate metabolism through SIRT3-dependent deacetylation. Globally increased mitochondrial acetylation in fasted liver tissue, higher stoichiometry at mitochondrial acetylation sites, and greater sensitivity of SIRT3-targeted sites to chemical acetylation in vitro and fasting-induced acetylation in vivo, suggest a nonenzymatic mechanism of acetylation.

We demonstrate that this hypoxia-suppressed miR-199a plays a decisive role in limiting glycolysis in HCC cells by targeting hexokinase-2 (Hk2) and pyruvate kinase-M2 (Pkm2). Furthermore, systemically delivered cholesterol-modified agomiR-199a inhibits [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake and attenuates tumor growth in HCC tumor-bearing mice.

Here, we analyze differential histone modifications between WT and MED23(-/-) (KO) cells and identify H2B mono-ubiquitination at lysine 120 (H2Bub) as a MED23-dependent histone modification. Using tandem affinity purification and mass spectrometry, we find that MED23 associates with the RNF20/40 complex, the enzyme for H2Bub, and show that this association is critical for the recruitment of RNF20/40 to chromatin. In a cell-free system, Mediator directly and substantially increases H2Bub on recombinant chromatin through its cooperation with RNF20/40 and the PAF complex. Integrative genome-wide analyses show that MED23 depletion specifically reduces H2Bub on a subset of MED23-controlled genes. Importantly, MED23-coupled H2Bub levels are oppositely regulated during myogenesis and lung carcinogenesis.

Abnormalities of the stress response are involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration, including ALS. Accordingly, we describe a novel mechanism for modulating microRNA biogenesis under stress, involving stress granule formation and re-organization of DICER and AGO2 protein interactions with their partners. In line with this observation, enhancing DICER activity by a small molecule, enoxacin, is beneficial for neuromuscular function in two independent ALS mouse models.

Using a proteomic-based approach, we identify the alpha3-subunit of Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) as a cell surface partner of alpha-syn assemblies. The interaction strength depended on the state of alpha-syn, fibrils being the strongest, oligomers weak, and monomers none. Mutations within the neuron-specific alpha3-subunit are linked to rapid-onset dystonia Parkinsonism (RDP) and alternating hemiplegia of childhood (AHC). We show that freely diffusing alpha3-NKA are trapped within alpha-syn clusters resulting in alpha3-NKA redistribution and formation of larger nanoclusters. This creates regions within the plasma membrane with reduced local densities of alpha3-NKA, thereby decreasing the efficiency of Na+ extrusion following stimulus.

Mice with PNKP inactivation in neural progenitors manifest neurodevelopmental abnormalities and postnatal death. This severe phenotype involved defective base excision repair and non-homologous end-joining, pathways required for repair of both DNA single- and double-strand breaks. Although mice homozygous for the T424GfsX48 allele were lethal embryonically, attenuated PNKP levels (akin to MCSZ) showed general neurodevelopmental defects, including microcephaly, indicating a critical developmental PNKP threshold.

Here, we identify a binding switch between phospho-ubiquitin (pUb) and the ubiquitin-like domain (Ubl) of Parkin as a key element. By mutagenesis and SAXS, we show that pUb binds to RING1 of Parkin at a site formed by His302 and Arg305. pUb binding promotes disengagement of the Ubl from RING1 and subsequent Parkin phosphorylation. A crystal structure of Parkin Delta86-130 at 2.54 A resolution allowed the design of mutations that specifically release the Ubl domain from RING1.

Furthermore, we demonstrate that the addition of phosphoubiquitin leads to displacement of the Ubl domain through loss of structure, unveiling a ubiquitin-binding site used by the E2~Ub conjugate, thus leading to active parkin. We find the role of the Ubl domain is to prevent parkin activity in the absence of the phosphorylation signals, and propose a model for parkin inhibition, optimization for phosphoubiquitin recruitment, release of inhibition by the Ubl domain and engagement with an E2~Ub conjugate.

Within the murine small intestine (SI), an activating mutation of beta-catenin took much longer to achieve Wnt deregulation and acquire a crypt-progenitor cell (CPC) phenotype than Apc or Gsk3 loss. Within the colon, a single activating mutation of beta-catenin was unable to drive Wnt deregulation or induce the CPC phenotype. This ability of beta-catenin mutation to differentially transform the SI versus the colon correlated with higher expression of E-cadherin and a higher number of E-cadherin:beta-catenin complexes at the membrane. Reduction in E-cadherin synergised with an activating mutation of beta-catenin resulting in a rapid CPC phenotype within the SI and colon.

Furthermore, we identified eight novel JNK-induced transcription factors that were required for proper EMT. Three of these factors were also highly expressed in invasive cancer cells where they function in gene regulation to maintain mesenchymal identity. These factors were also induced during neuronal development and function in neuronal migration in vivo. These comprehensive findings uncovered a kinetically distinct role for the JNK pathway in defining the transcriptome that underlies mesenchymal identity and revealed novel transcription factors that mediate these responses during development and disease.",JNK-dependent gene regulatory circuitry governs mesenchymal fate.,The EMBO journal
26139537,"Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) regulates signaling from the plasma membrane. Analysis of clathrin-coated pit (CCP) dynamics led us to propose the existence of a rate-limiting, regulatory step(s) that monitor the fidelity of early stages in CCP maturation. Here we show that nascent endocytic vesicles formed in mutant cells displaying rapid, dysregulated CME are defective in early endosomal trafficking, maturation and acidification, confirming the importance of this ""checkpoint."" Dysregulated CME also alters EGF receptor signaling and leads to constitutive activation of the protein kinase Akt. Dynamin-1, which was thought to be neuron specific, is activated by the Akt/GSK3beta signaling cascade in non-neuronal cells to trigger rapid, dysregulated CME. Acute activation of dynamin-1 in RPE cells by inhibition of GSK3beta accelerates CME, alters CCP dynamics and, unexpectedly, increases the rate of CCP initiation. CRISPR-Cas9n-mediated knockout and reconstitution studies establish that dynamin-1 is activated by Akt/GSK3beta signaling in H1299 non-small lung cancer cells. These findings provide direct evidence for an isoform-specific role for dynamin in regulating CME and reveal a feed-forward pathway that could link signaling from cell surface receptors to the regulation of CME.",Crosstalk between Akt/GSK3beta signaling and dynamin-1 regulates clathrin-mediated endocytosis.,The EMBO journal
26139536,"Lysosomes are essential organelles that function to degrade and recycle unwanted, damaged and toxic biological components. Lysosomes also act as signalling platforms in activating the nutrient-sensing kinase mTOR. mTOR regulates cellular growth, but it also helps to maintain lysosome identity by initiating lysosomal tubulation through a process termed autophagosome-lysosome reformation (ALR). Here we identify a lysosomal pool of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate that, when depleted by specific inhibition of the class III phosphoinositide 3-kinase VPS34, results in prolonged lysosomal tubulation. This tubulation requires mTOR activity, and we identified two direct mTOR phosphorylation sites on UVRAG (S550 and S571) that activate VPS34. Loss of these phosphorylation sites reduced VPS34 lipid kinase activity and resulted in an increase in number and length of lysosomal tubules. In cells in which phosphorylation at these UVRAG sites is disrupted, the result of impaired lysosomal tubulation alongside ALR activation is massive cell death. Our data imply that ALR is critical for cell survival under nutrient stress and that VPS34 is an essential regulatory element in this process.",mTOR activates the VPS34-UVRAG complex to regulate autolysosomal tubulation and cell survival.,The EMBO journal

While the expression of c-MYC can be aberrantly driven by genetic abnormalities, such as chromosomal translocations directly involving the MYC locus or mutations of its upstream regulators, how c-MYC expression is induced and amplified in normal lymphocytes in response to antigen stimulation remains elusive.

26139534,"T cells infiltrating neoplasms express surface molecules typical of chronically virus-stimulated T cells, often termed ""exhausted"" T cells. We compared the transcriptome of ""exhausted"" CD8 T cells infiltrating autochthonous melanomas to those of naive and acutely stimulated CD8 T cells. Despite strong similarities between transcriptional signatures of tumor- and virus-induced exhausted CD8 T cells, notable differences appeared. Among transcriptional regulators, Nr4a2 and Maf were highly overexpressed in tumor-exhausted T cells and significantly upregulated in CD8 T cells from human melanoma metastases. Transduction of murine tumor-specific CD8 T cells to express Maf partially reproduced the transcriptional program associated with tumor-induced exhaustion. Upon adoptive transfer, the transduced cells showed normal homeostasis but failed to accumulate in tumor-bearing hosts and developed defective anti-tumor effector responses. We further identified TGFbeta and IL-6 as main inducers of Maf expression in CD8 T cells and showed that Maf-deleted tumor-specific CD8 T cells were much more potent to restrain tumor growth in vivo. Therefore, the melanoma microenvironment contributes to skewing of CD8 T cell differentiation programs, in part by TGFbeta/IL-6-mediated induction of Maf.",Molecular profiling of CD8 T cells in autochthonous melanoma identifies Maf as driver of exhaustion.,The EMBO journal
26136213,"There is a long-standing association between wound healing and cancer, with cancer often described as a ""wound that does not heal"". However, little is known about how wounding, such as following surgery, biopsy collection or ulceration, might impact on cancer progression. Here, we use a translucent zebrafish larval model of Ras(G12V)-driven neoplasia to image the interactions between inflammatory cells drawn to a wound, and to adjacent pre-neoplastic cells. We show that neutrophils are rapidly diverted from a wound to pre-neoplastic cells and these interactions lead to increased proliferation of the pre-neoplastic cells. One of the wound-inflammation-induced trophic signals is prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). In an adult model of chronic wounding in zebrafish, we show that repeated wounding with subsequent inflammation leads to a greater incidence of local melanoma formation. Our zebrafish studies led us to investigate the innate immune cell associations in ulcerated melanomas in human patients. We find a strong correlation between neutrophil presence at sites of melanoma ulceration and cell proliferation at these sites, which is associated with poor prognostic outcome.",The wound inflammatory response exacerbates growth of pre-neoplastic cells and progression to cancer.,The EMBO journal
26136212,Myc controls the metabolic reprogramming that supports effector T cell differentiation. The expression of Myc is regulated by the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-2 (IL-2). We now show that the TCR is a digital switch for Myc mRNA and protein expression that allows the strength of the antigen stimulus to determine the frequency of T cells that express Myc. IL-2 signalling strength also directs Myc expression but in an analogue process that fine-tunes Myc quantity in individual cells via post-transcriptional control of Myc protein. Fine-tuning Myc matters and is possible as Myc protein has a very short half-life in T cells due to its constant phosphorylation by glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) and subsequent proteasomal degradation. We show that Myc only accumulates in T cells exhibiting high levels of amino acid uptake allowing T cells to match Myc expression to biosynthetic demands. The combination of digital and analogue processes allows tight control of Myc expression at the population and single cell level during immune responses.,Single cell tuning of Myc expression by antigen receptor signal strength and interleukin-2 in T lymphocytes.,The EMBO journal

A clathrin- and caveolin-independent endocytosis pathway is used by important physiological cargos, including interleukin-2 receptors (IL-2R). However, this process lacks morphological and dynamic data. Our electron microscopy (EM) and tomography studies reveal that IL-2R-pits and vesicles are initiated at the base of protrusions. We identify the WAVE complex as a specific endocytic actor. The WAVE complex interacts with IL-2R, via a WAVE-interacting receptor sequence (WIRS) present in the receptor polypeptide, and allows for receptor clustering close to membrane protrusions. In addition, using total internal reflection fluorescent microscopy (TIRF) and automated analysis we demonstrate that two timely distinct bursts of actin polymerization are required during IL-2R uptake, promoted first by the WAVE complex and then by N-WASP. Finally, our data reveal that dynamin acts as a transition controller for the recruitment of Arp2/3 activators required for IL-2R endocytosis. Altogether, our work identifies the spatio-temporal specific role of factors initiating clathrin-independent endocytosis by a unique mechanism that does not depend on the deformation of a flat membrane, but rather on that of membrane protrusions.",Membrane protrusion powers clathrin-independent endocytosis of interleukin-2 receptor.,The EMBO journal
26113155,"Obstructions to replication fork progression, referred to collectively as DNA replication stress, challenge genome stability. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, cells lacking RTT107 or SLX4 show genome instability and sensitivity to DNA replication stress and are defective in the completion of DNA replication during recovery from replication stress. We demonstrate that Slx4 is recruited to chromatin behind stressed replication forks, in a region that is spatially distinct from that occupied by the replication machinery. Slx4 complex formation is nucleated by Mec1 phosphorylation of histone H2A, which is recognized by the constitutive Slx4 binding partner Rtt107. Slx4 is essential for recruiting the Mec1 activator Dpb11 behind stressed replication forks, and Slx4 complexes are important for full activity of Mec1. We propose that Slx4 complexes promote robust checkpoint signaling by Mec1 by stably recruiting Dpb11 within a discrete domain behind the replication fork, during DNA replication stress.",Assembly of Slx4 signaling complexes behind DNA replication forks.,The EMBO journal
26108535,"Recycling synaptic vesicles (SVs) transit through early endosomal sorting stations, which raises a fundamental question: are SVs sorted toward endolysosomal pathways? Here, we used snapin mutants as tools to assess how endolysosomal sorting and trafficking impact presynaptic activity in wild-type and snapin(-/-) neurons. Snapin acts as a dynein adaptor that mediates the retrograde transport of late endosomes (LEs) and interacts with dysbindin, a subunit of the endosomal sorting complex BLOC-1. Expressing dynein-binding defective snapin mutants induced SV accumulation at presynaptic terminals, mimicking the snapin(-/-) phenotype. Conversely, over-expressing snapin reduced SV pool size by enhancing SV trafficking to the endolysosomal pathway. Using a SV-targeted Ca(2+) sensor, we demonstrate that snapin-dysbindin interaction regulates SV positional priming through BLOC-1/AP-3-dependent sorting. Our study reveals a bipartite regulation of presynaptic activity by endolysosomal trafficking and sorting: LE transport regulates SV pool size, and BLOC-1/AP-3-dependent sorting fine-tunes the Ca(2+) sensitivity of SV release. Therefore, our study provides new mechanistic insights into the maintenance and regulation of SV pool size and synchronized SV fusion through snapin-mediated LE trafficking and endosomal sorting.",Regulation of synaptic activity by snapin-mediated endolysosomal transport and sorting.,The EMBO journal
26105073,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important regulators of neuronal development, network connectivity, and synaptic plasticity. While many neuronal miRNAs were previously shown to modulate neuronal morphogenesis, little is known regarding the regulation of miRNA function. In a large-scale functional screen, we identified two novel regulators of neuronal miRNA function, Nova1 and Ncoa3. Both proteins are expressed in the nucleus and the cytoplasm of developing hippocampal neurons. We found that Nova1 and Ncoa3 stimulate miRNA function by different mechanisms that converge on Argonaute (Ago) proteins, core components of the miRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC). While Nova1 physically interacts with Ago proteins, Ncoa3 selectively promotes the expression of Ago2 at the transcriptional level. We further show that Ncoa3 regulates dendritic complexity and dendritic spine maturation of hippocampal neurons in a miRNA-dependent fashion. Importantly, both the loss of miRNA activity and increased dendrite complexity upon Ncoa3 knockdown were rescued by Ago2 overexpression. Together, we uncovered two novel factors that control neuronal miRISC function at the level of Ago proteins, with possible implications for the regulation of synapse development and plasticity.",A large-scale functional screen identifies Nova1 and Ncoa3 as regulators of neuronal miRNA function.,The EMBO journal
26101372,"TRIM5alpha is an antiviral, cytoplasmic, E3 ubiquitin (Ub) ligase that assembles on incoming retroviral capsids and induces their premature dissociation. It inhibits reverse transcription of the viral genome and can also synthesize unanchored polyubiquitin (polyUb) chains to stimulate innate immune responses. Here, we show that TRIM5alpha employs the E2 Ub-conjugating enzyme Ube2W to anchor the Lys63-linked polyUb chains in a process of TRIM5alpha auto-ubiquitination. Chain anchoring is initiated, in cells and in vitro, through Ube2W-catalyzed monoubiquitination of TRIM5alpha. This modification serves as a substrate for the elongation of anchored Lys63-linked polyUb chains, catalyzed by the heterodimeric E2 enzyme Ube2N/Ube2V2. Ube2W targets multiple TRIM5alpha internal lysines with Ub especially lysines 45 and 50, rather than modifying the N-terminal amino group, which is instead alphaN-acetylated in cells. E2 depletion or Ub mutation inhibits TRIM5alpha ubiquitination in cells and restores restricted viral reverse transcription, but not infection. Our data indicate that the stepwise formation of anchored Lys63-linked polyUb is a critical early step in the TRIM5alpha restriction mechanism and identify the E2 Ub-conjugating cofactors involved.",TRIM5alpha requires Ube2W to anchor Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains and restrict reverse transcription.,The EMBO journal

And-1 is phosphorylated at T826 by ATR following replication stress, and this phosphorylation is required for And-1 to accumulate at the damage sites, where And-1 promotes the interaction between Claspin and Chk1, thereby stimulating efficient Chk1 activation by ATR. Significantly, And-1 binds directly to ssDNA and facilitates the association of Claspin with ssDNA. Furthermore, And-1 associates with replication forks and is required for the recovery of stalled forks.

26077448,"The intestinal epithelium is remarkably robust despite perturbations and demand uncertainty. Here, we investigate the basis of such robustness using novel tracing methods that allow simultaneously capturing the dynamics of stem and committed progenitor cells (called enteroblasts) and intestinal cell turnover with spatiotemporal resolution. We found that intestinal stem cells (ISCs) divide ""ahead"" of demand during Drosophila midgut homeostasis. Their newborn enteroblasts, on the other hand, take on a highly polarized shape, acquire invasive properties and motility. They extend long membrane protrusions that make cell-cell contact with mature cells, while exercising a capacity to delay their final differentiation until a local demand materializes. This cellular plasticity is mechanistically linked to the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) programme mediated by escargot, a snail family gene. Activation of the conserved microRNA miR-8/miR-200 in ""pausing"" enteroblasts in response to a local cell loss promotes timely terminal differentiation via a reverse MET by antagonizing escargot.

After replication forks collide with an ICL, the leading strand approaches to within one nucleotide of the ICL (""approach""), a nucleotide is inserted across from the unhooked lesion (""insertion""), and the leading strand is extended beyond the lesion (""extension""). How DNA polymerases bypass the ICL is incompletely understood. Here, we use repair of a site-specific ICL in Xenopus egg extracts to study the mechanism of lesion bypass. Deep sequencing of ICL repair products showed that the approach and extension steps are largely error-free. However, a short mutagenic tract is introduced in the vicinity of the lesion, with a maximum mutation frequency of ~1%. Our data further suggest that approach is performed by a replicative polymerase, while extension involves a complex of Rev1 and DNA polymerase zeta.

26069325,"In multicellular organisms, temporal and spatial regulation of cell proliferation is central for generating organs with defined sizes and morphologies. For establishing and maintaining the post-mitotic quiescent state during cell differentiation, it is important to repress genes with mitotic functions. We found that three of the Arabidopsis MYB3R transcription factors synergistically maintain G2/M-specific genes repressed in post-mitotic cells and restrict the time window of mitotic gene expression in proliferating cells. The combined mutants of the three repressor-type MYB3R genes displayed long roots, enlarged leaves, embryos, and seeds. Genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that MYB3R3 binds to the promoters of G2/M-specific genes and to E2F target genes. MYB3R3 associates with the repressor-type E2F, E2FC, and the RETINOBLASTOMA RELATED proteins. In contrast, the activator MYB3R4 was in complex with E2FB in proliferating cells. With mass spectrometry and pairwise interaction assays, we identified some of the other conserved components of the multiprotein complexes, known as DREAM/dREAM in human and flies.

To investigate the influence of chromatin organisation and dynamics on the response to Notch signalling, we partitioned Drosophila chromatin using histone modifications and established the preferred chromatin conditions for binding of Su(H), the Notch pathway transcription factor. By manipulating activity of a co-operating factor, Lozenge/Runx, we showed that it can help facilitate these conditions. While many histone modifications were unchanged by Su(H) binding or Notch activation, we detected rapid changes in acetylation of H3K56 at Notch-regulated enhancers. This modification extended over large regions, required the histone acetyl-transferase CBP and was independent of transcription. Such rapid changes in H3K56 acetylation appear to be a conserved indicator of enhancer activation as they also occurred at the mammalian Notch-regulated Hey1 gene and at Drosophila ecdysone-regulated genes. This intriguing example of a core histone modification increasing over short timescales may therefore underpin changes in chromatin accessibility needed to promote transcription following signalling activation.",Chromatin signatures at Notch-regulated enhancers reveal large-scale changes in H3K56ac upon activation.,The EMBO journal

To gain mechanistic insight into their mode of action, we reconstituted the assembly machinery from recombinant sources. We uncover a stepwise and ordered formation of distinct Sm protein complexes on the PRMT5 complex, which is facilitated by the assembly chaperone pICln. Upon completion, the formed pICln-Sm units are displaced by new pICln-Sm protein substrates and transferred onto the SMN complex. The latter acts as a Brownian machine that couples spontaneous conformational changes driven by thermal energy to prevent mis-assembly and to ensure the transfer of Sm proteins to cognate RNA. Investigation of mutant SMN complexes provided insight into the contribution of individual proteins to these activities.

The structures reveal that zalcitabine binds to the Pol gamma active site almost identically to the substrate dCTP, providing a structural basis for Pol gamma-mediated drug toxicity. When compared to the apo form, Pol gamma undergoes intra- and inter-subunit conformational changes upon formation of the ternary complex with primer/template DNA and substrate. We also find that the accessory subunit Pol gammaB, which lacks intrinsic enzymatic activity and does not contact the primer/template DNA directly, serves as an allosteric regulator of holoenzyme activities.

At least 7 distinct contact sites between the ER and endosomes have been identified to date, which have diverse molecular compositions. Common to these contact sites is that they impose a close apposition between the ER and endosome membranes, which excludes membrane fusion while allowing the flow of molecular signals between the two membranes, in the form of enzymatic modifications, or ion, lipid, or protein transfer. Thus, ER-endosome contact sites ensure coordination of molecular activities between the two compartments while keeping their general compositions intact.

Using biochemistry, single-molecule, and deep sequencing techniques, we here investigate the mechanism by which human TUT7 (also known as ZCCHC6) recognizes and uridylates precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) in the absence of Lin28. We find that the overhang of a pre-miRNA is the key structural element that is recognized by TUT7 and its paralogues, TUT4 (ZCCHC11) and TUT2 (GLD2/PAPD4). For group II pre-miRNAs, which have a 1-nt 3' overhang, TUT7 restores the canonical end structure (2-nt 3' overhang) through mono-uridylation, thereby promoting miRNA biogenesis. For pre-miRNAs where the 3' end is further recessed into the stem (as in 3' trimmed pre-miRNAs), TUT7 generates an oligo-U tail that leads to degradation. In contrast to Lin28-stimulated oligo-uridylation, which is processive, a distributive mode is employed by TUT7 for both mono- and oligo-uridylation in the absence of Lin28. The overhang length dictates the frequency (but not duration) of the TUT7-RNA interaction, thus explaining how TUT7 differentiates pre-miRNA species with different overhangs.

Co-immunoprecipitation studies establish that gamma-secretase associates with CRFR1; this is mediated by beta-arrestin binding motifs. Additionally, CRFR1 and gamma-secretase co-localize in lipid raft fractions, with increased gamma-secretase accumulation upon CRF treatment.

CRF is the first endogenous neuropeptide that can be shown to directly modulate gamma-secretase activity. Unexpectedly, CRFR1 antagonists also increased Abeta. These data collectively link CRF to increased Abeta through gamma-secretase and provide mechanistic insight into how stress may increase AD risk. They also suggest that direct targeting of CRF might be necessary to effectively modulate this pathway for therapeutic benefit in AD, as CRFR1 antagonists increase Abeta and in some cases preferentially increase Abeta42 via complex effects on gamma-secretase.",The stress response neuropeptide CRF increases amyloid-beta production by regulating gamma-secretase activity.,The EMBO journal

However, the mechanisms responsible for this upregulation are unknown. Here, we show that an OTU domain deubiquitinase, OTUD4, is a positive regulator of ALKBH2 and ALKBH3, two DNA demethylases critical for alkylation repair. Remarkably, we find that OTUD4 catalytic activity is completely dispensable for this function. Rather, OTUD4 is a scaffold for USP7 and USP9X, two deubiquitinases that act directly on the AlkB proteins. Moreover, we show that loss of OTUD4, USP7, or USP9X in tumor cells makes them significantly more sensitive to alkylating agents. Taken together, this work reveals a novel, noncanonical mechanism by which an OTU family deubiquitinase regulates its substrates, and provides multiple new targets for alkylation chemotherapy sensitization of tumors.",Noncanonical regulation of alkylation damage resistance by the OTUD4 deubiquitinase.,The EMBO journal
25940072,"The receptor-binding specificity of influenza A viruses is a major determinant for the host tropism of the virus, which enables interspecies transmission. In 2013, the first human case of infection with avian influenza A (H6N1) virus was reported in Taiwan. To gather evidence concerning the epidemic potential of H6 subtype viruses, we performed comprehensive analysis of receptor-binding properties of Taiwan-isolated H6 HAs from 1972 to 2013. We propose that the receptor-binding properties of Taiwan-isolated H6 HAs have undergone three major stages: initially avian receptor-binding preference, secondarily obtaining human receptor-binding capacity, and recently human receptor-binding preference, which has been confirmed by receptor-binding assessment of three representative virus isolates. Mutagenesis work revealed that E190V and G228S substitutions are important to acquire the human receptor-binding capacity, and the P186L substitution could reduce the binding to avian receptor. Further structural analysis revealed how the P186L substitution in the receptor-binding site of HA determines the receptor-binding preference change. We conclude that the human-infecting H6N1 evolved into a human receptor preference.",Adaptation of avian influenza A (H6N1) virus from avian to human receptor-binding preference.,The EMBO journal
25940071,"Chronic neuroinflammation is evident in brain aging and neurodegenerative disorders and is often associated with excessive nitric oxide (NO) production within the central nervous system (CNS). Under such conditions, increased NO levels are observed at the choroid plexus (CP), an epithelial layer that forms the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB) and serves as a selective gateway for leukocyte entry to the CNS in homeostasis and following injury. Here, we hypothesized that elevated cerebral NO levels interfere with CP gateway activity. We found that induction of leukocyte trafficking determinants by the CP and sequential leukocyte entry to the CSF are dependent on the CP epithelial NFkappaB/p65 signaling pathway, which was inhibited upon exposure to NO. Examining the CP in 5XFAD transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD-Tg) revealed impaired ability to mount an NFkappaB/p65-dependent response. Systemic administration of an NO scavenger in AD-Tg mice alleviated NFkappaB/p65 suppression at the CP and augmented its gateway activity. Together, our findings identify cerebral NO as a negative regulator of CP gateway activity for immune cell trafficking to the CNS.",Cerebral nitric oxide represses choroid plexus NFkappaB-dependent gateway activity for leukocyte trafficking.,The EMBO journal

These approaches have granted us unrestricted access to the brain and spinal cord of patients and have allowed for the study of disease in the context of human cells, expressing physiological levels of proteins and under each patient's unique genetic constellation. Along with this unprecedented opportunity have come significant challenges, particularly in relation to patient variability, experimental design and data interpretation. Nevertheless, significant progress has been achieved over the past few years both in our ability to create the various neural subtypes that comprise the nervous system and in our efforts to develop cellular models of disease that recapitulate clinical findings identified in patients.

PERK, a key upstream component, recognizes ER stress via its luminal sensor/transducer domain, but the molecular events that lead to UPR activation remain unclear. Here, we describe the crystal structures of mammalian PERK luminal domains captured in dimeric state as well as in a novel tetrameric state. Small angle X-ray scattering analysis (SAXS) supports the existence of both crystal structures also in solution. The salient feature of the tetramer interface, a helix swapped between dimers, implies transient association. Moreover, interface mutations that disrupt tetramer formation in vitro reduce phosphorylation of PERK and its target eIF2alpha in cells. These results suggest that transient conversion from dimeric to tetrameric state may be a key regulatory step in UPR activation.",Crystal structures reveal transient PERK luminal domain tetramerization in endoplasmic reticulum stress signaling.,The EMBO journal

We show that MSH2 interacts with FEN1 and facilitates its nuclease activity to remove mismatches near the 5' ends of DNA substrates. Mouse cells and mice encoding FEN1 mutations display AEE deficiency, a strong mutator phenotype, enhanced cellular transformation, and increased cancer susceptibility.

For example, sugar feeding promotes lipogenesis by activating glycolytic and lipogenic genes through the Mondo/ChREBP-Mlx transcription factor complex. Concomitantly, other metabolic routes are inhibited, but the mechanisms of transcriptional repression upon sugar sensing have remained elusive. Here, we characterize cabut (cbt), a transcription factor responsible for the repressive branch of the sugar sensing transcriptional network in Drosophila. We demonstrate that cbt is rapidly induced upon sugar feeding through direct regulation by Mondo-Mlx. We found that CBT represses several metabolic targets in response to sugar feeding, including both isoforms of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (pepck). Deregulation of pepck1 (CG17725) in mlx mutants underlies imbalance of glycerol and glucose metabolism as well as developmental lethality. Furthermore, we demonstrate that cbt provides a regulatory link between nutrient sensing and the circadian clock. Specifically, we show that a subset of genes regulated by the circadian clock are also targets of CBT. Moreover, perturbation of CBT levels leads to deregulation of the circadian transcriptome and circadian behavioral patterns.",The transcription factor Cabut coordinates energy metabolism and the circadian clock in response to sugar sensing.,The EMBO journal

However, the specific role of neuropeptide Y (NPY) in this process has not been systematically studied. Here we show that NPY-deficient mice have significantly reduced hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) numbers and impaired regeneration in bone marrow due to apoptotic destruction of SNS fibers and/or endothelial cells. Furthermore, pharmacological elevation of NPY prevented bone marrow impairments in a mouse model of chemotherapy-induced SNS injury, while NPY injection into conditional knockout mice lacking the Y1 receptor in macrophages did not relieve bone marrow dysfunction. These results indicate that NPY promotes neuroprotection and restores bone marrow dysfunction from chemotherapy-induced SNS injury through the Y1 receptor in macrophages.

We present a large-scale transcriptomic analysis of individual germinal layers in the developing cortex of the gyrencephalic ferret, comparing between regions prospective of fold and fissure. We find unique transcriptional signatures in each germinal compartment, where thousands of genes are differentially expressed between regions, including ~80% of genes mutated in human cortical malformations. These regional differences emerge from the existence of discrete domains of gene expression, which occur at multiple locations across the developing cortex of ferret and human, but not the lissencephalic mouse. Complex expression patterns emerge late during development and map the eventual location of folds or fissures. Protomaps of gene expression within germinal layers may contribute to define cortical folds or functional areas, but our findings demonstrate that they distinguish the development of gyrencephalic cortices.",Discrete domains of gene expression in germinal layers distinguish the development of gyrencephaly.,The EMBO journal
25908841,"The nervous system is comprised of a vast diversity of distinct neural cell types. Differences between neuronal subtypes drive the assembly of neuronal circuits and underlie the subtype specificity of many neurological diseases. Yet, because neurons are irreversibly post-mitotic and not readily available from patients, it has not been feasible to study specific subtypes of human neurons in larger numbers. A powerful means to study neuronal diversity and neurological disease is to establish methods to produce desired neuronal subtypes in vitro. Traditionally this has been accomplished by treating pluripotent or neural stem cells with growth factors and morphogens that recapitulate exogenous developmental signals. These approaches often require extended periods of culture, which can limit their utility. However, more recently, it has become possible to produce neurons directly from fibroblasts using transcription factors and/or microRNAs. This technique referred to as direct reprogramming or transdifferentiation has proven to be a rapid, robust, and reproducible method to generate mature neurons of many different subtypes from multiple cell sources. Here, we highlight recent advances in generating neurons of specific subtypes using direct reprogramming and outline various scenarios in which induced neurons may be applied to studies of neuronal function and neurological disease.",Forward engineering neuronal diversity using direct reprogramming.,The EMBO journal

Lineage analysis in the fish retina identified rx2 as marker for multipotent NSCs. rx2-positive cells located in the peripheral ciliary marginal zone behave as stem cells for the neuroretina, or the retinal pigmented epithelium. We identified upstream regulators of rx2 interrogating the rx2 pCRE in a trans-regulation screen and focused on four TFs (Sox2, Tlx, Gli3, and Her9) activating or repressing rx2 expression. We demonstrated direct interaction of the rx2 pCRE with the four factors in vitro and in vivo. By conditional mosaic gain- and loss-of-function analyses, we validated the activity of those factors on regulating rx2 transcription and consequently modulating neuroretinal and RPE stem cell features. This becomes obvious by the rx2-mutant phenotypes that together with the data presented above identify rx2 as a transcriptional hub balancing stemness of neuroretinal and RPE stem cells in the adult fish retina.","Sox2, Tlx, Gli3, and Her9 converge on Rx2 to define retinal stem cells in vivo.",The EMBO journal

This approach also offers the unique opportunity to study otherwise inaccessible aspects of human beta cell development and function in vitro. Here, we show that current pancreatic progenitor differentiation protocols promote precocious endocrine commitment, ultimately resulting in the generation of non-functional polyhormonal cells. Omission of commonly used BMP inhibitors during pancreatic specification prevents precocious endocrine formation while treatment with retinoic acid followed by combined EGF/KGF efficiently generates both PDX1(+) and subsequent PDX1(+)/NKX6.1(+) pancreatic progenitor populations, respectively. Precise temporal activation of endocrine differentiation in PDX1(+)/NKX6.1(+) progenitors produces glucose-responsive beta-like cells in vitro that exhibit key features of bona fide human beta cells, remain functional after short-term transplantation, and reduce blood glucose levels in diabetic mice. Thus, our simplified and scalable system accurately recapitulates key steps of human pancreas development and provides a fast and reproducible supply of functional human beta-like cells.",Controlled induction of human pancreatic progenitors produces functional beta-like cells in vitro.,The EMBO journal
25899817,"DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair by homologous recombination (HR) requires 3' single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) generation by 5' DNA-end resection. During meiosis, yeast Sae2 cooperates with the nuclease Mre11 to remove covalently bound Spo11 from DSB termini, allowing resection and HR to ensue. Mitotic roles of Sae2 and Mre11 nuclease have remained enigmatic, however, since cells lacking these display modest resection defects but marked DNA damage hypersensitivities. By combining classic genetic suppressor screening with high-throughput DNA sequencing, we identify Mre11 mutations that strongly suppress DNA damage sensitivities of sae2 cells. By assessing the impacts of these mutations at the cellular, biochemical and structural levels, we propose that, in addition to promoting resection, a crucial role for Sae2 and Mre11 nuclease activity in mitotic DSB repair is to facilitate the removal of Mre11 from ssDNA associated with DSB ends. Thus, without Sae2 or Mre11 nuclease activity, Mre11 bound to partly processed DSBs impairs strand invasion and HR.",Synthetic viability genomic screening defines Sae2 function in DNA repair.,The EMBO journal

Microglia dysregulation is thought to be causal for a group of neuropsychiatric, neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory diseases, called ""microgliopathies"". However, how the intracellular stimulation machinery in microglia is controlled is poorly understood. Here, we identified the ubiquitin-specific protease (Usp) 18 in white matter microglia that essentially contributes to microglial quiescence. We further found that microglial Usp18 negatively regulates the activation of Stat1 and concomitant induction of interferon-induced genes, thereby terminating IFN signaling. The Usp18-mediated control was independent from its catalytic activity but instead required the interaction with Ifnar2. Additionally, the absence of Ifnar1 restored microglial activation, indicating a tonic IFN signal which needs to be negatively controlled by Usp18 under non-diseased conditions. These results identify Usp18 as a critical negative regulator of microglia activation and demonstrate a protective role of Usp18 for microglia function by regulating the Ifnar pathway.

In mice, zygotic transcription is first detected shortly after pronucleus formation in 1-cell embryos, but the identity of the transcribed loci and mechanisms regulating their expression are not known. Using total RNA-Seq, we have found that transcription in 1-cell embryos is highly promiscuous, such that intergenic regions are extensively expressed and thousands of genes are transcribed at comparably low levels. Striking is that transcription can occur in the absence of defined core-promoter elements. Furthermore, accumulation of translatable zygotic mRNAs is minimal in 1-cell embryos because of inefficient splicing and 3' processing of nascent transcripts. These findings provide novel insights into regulation of gene expression in 1-cell mouse embryos that may confer a protective mechanism against precocious gene expression that is the product of a relaxed chromatin structure present in 1-cell embryos. The results also suggest that the first zygotic transcription itself is an active component of chromatin remodeling in 1-cell embryos.",The first murine zygotic transcription is promiscuous and uncoupled from splicing and 3' processing.,The EMBO journal

Mechanisms for checkpoint down-regulation are therefore necessary for proper cellular proliferation. We recently uncovered a phosphatase-independent mechanism for dampening checkpoint signalling, where the checkpoint adaptor Rad9 is counteracted by the repair scaffolds Slx4-Rtt107. Here, we establish the molecular requirements for this new mode of checkpoint regulation. We engineered a minimal multi-BRCT-domain (MBD) module that recapitulates the action of Slx4-Rtt107 in checkpoint down-regulation. MBD mimics the damage-induced Dpb11-Slx4-Rtt107 complex by synergistically interacting with lesion-specific phospho-sites in Ddc1 and H2A. We propose that efficient recruitment of Dpb11-Slx4-Rtt107 or MBD via a cooperative 'two-site-docking' mechanism displaces Rad9.

How cells discriminate physiological from supraphysiological levels of Myc is largely unknown. Here, we show that induction of apoptosis by Myc in breast epithelial cells requires association of Myc with Miz1. Gene expression and ChIP-Sequencing experiments show that high levels of Myc invade target sites that lack consensus E-boxes in a complex with Miz1 and repress transcription. Myc/Miz1-repressed genes encode proteins involved in cell adhesion and migration and include several integrins. Promoters of repressed genes are enriched for binding sites of the serum-response factor (SRF). Restoring SRF activity antagonizes Myc repression of SRF target genes, attenuates Myc-induced apoptosis, and reverts a Myc-dependent decrease in Akt phosphorylation and activity, a well-characterized suppressor of Myc-induced apoptosis.

By generating the first mouse line with demonstrable absence of both Tpcn1 and Tpcn2 expression (Tpcn1/2(-/-)), we show that the loss of endogenous TPCs abolished NAADP-dependent Ca(2+) responses as assessed by single-cell Ca(2+) imaging or patch-clamp of single endo-lysosomes. In contrast, currents stimulated by PI(3,5)P2 were only partially dependent on TPCs. In Tpcn1/2(-/-) cells, NAADP sensitivity was restored by re-expressing wild-type TPCs, but not by mutant versions with impaired Ca(2+)-permeability, nor by TRPML1. Another mouse line formerly reported as TPC-null likely expresses truncated TPCs, but we now show that these truncated proteins still support NAADP-induced Ca(2+) release. High-affinity [(32)P]NAADP binding still occurs in Tpcn1/2(-/-) tissue, suggesting that NAADP regulation is conferred by an accessory protein.

UBL5-deficient cells display spliceosome-independent reduction of FANCI protein stability, defective FANCI function in response to DNA damage and hypersensitivity to ICLs.

Insm1-dependent genes identified previously in developing beta-cells markedly differ from the ones identified in the adult. In particular, adult mutant beta-cells resemble immature beta-cells of newborn mice in gene expression and functional properties. We defined Insm1, Neurod1 and Foxa2 binding sites associated with genes deregulated in Insm1 mutant beta-cells.

Here, we analyze the response of primary human cells and murine hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to aneuploidy induction and the role of telomeres and the telomerase in this process. The study shows that aneuploidy induces replication stress at telomeres leading to telomeric DNA damage and p53 activation. This results in p53/Rb-dependent, premature senescence of human fibroblast, and in the depletion of hematopoietic cells in telomerase-deficient mice. Endogenous telomerase expression in HSCs and enforced expression of telomerase in human fibroblasts are sufficient to abrogate aneuploidy-induced replication stress at telomeres and the consequent induction of premature senescence and hematopoietic cell depletion.

Although changes to cell fate can be achieved in this way, the efficiency of such conversion remains very low, in large part due to specific chromatin signatures constituting an epigenetic barrier to the transcription factor-mediated reprogramming processes. Here we discuss the two-way relationship between transcription factor binding and chromatin structure during cell fate reprogramming.

25796446,"Increased glucose metabolism and reprogramming toward aerobic glycolysis are a hallmark of cancer cells, meeting their metabolic needs for sustained cell proliferation. Metabolic reprogramming is usually considered as a downstream consequence of tumor development and oncogene activation; growing evidence indicates, however, that metabolism on its turn can support oncogenic signaling to foster tumor malignancy. Here, we explored how glucose metabolism regulates gene transcription and found an unexpected link with YAP/TAZ, key transcription factors regulating organ growth, tumor cell proliferation and aggressiveness. When cells actively incorporate glucose and route it through glycolysis, YAP/TAZ are fully active; when glucose metabolism is blocked, or glycolysis is reduced, YAP/TAZ transcriptional activity is decreased. Accordingly, glycolysis is required to sustain YAP/TAZ pro-tumorigenic functions, and YAP/TAZ are required for the full deployment of glucose growth-promoting activity. Mechanistically we found that phosphofructokinase (PFK1), the enzyme regulating the first committed step of glycolysis, binds the YAP/TAZ transcriptional cofactors TEADs and promotes their functional and biochemical cooperation with YAP/TAZ. Strikingly, this regulation is conserved in Drosophila, where phosphofructokinase is required for tissue overgrowth promoted by Yki, the fly homologue of YAP. Moreover, gene expression regulated by glucose metabolism in breast cancer cells is strongly associated in a large dataset of primary human mammary tumors with YAP/TAZ activation and with the progression toward more advanced and malignant stages.

Immunized mice depleted of tTregs showed an increased response of IFN-gamma-secreting CD4(+) T cells that was strictly reliant on a functional CD27/CD70 pathway. In vitro studies revealed that tTregs downregulate CD70 from the plasma membrane of dendritic cells (DCs) in a CD27-dependent manner.

However, the 2',3'-cyclic phosphate-terminated nick is also processed by Top1 incision, generally 2 nucleotides upstream of the nick, which produces a covalent Top1-DNA complex with a 2-nucleotide gap. We show that these covalent complexes can be processed by proteolysis, followed by removal of the phospho-peptide by Tdp1 and the 3'-phosphate by Tpp1 to mediate error-free repair. However, when the 2-nucleotide gap is associated with a dinucleotide repeat sequence, sequence slippage re-alignment followed by Top1-mediated religation can occur which results in 2-nucleotide deletion. The efficiency of deletion formation shows strong sequence-context dependence.",Error-free and mutagenic processing of topoisomerase 1-provoked damage at genomic ribonucleotides.,The EMBO journal
25777528,"The molecular motor kinesin moves along microtubules using energy from ATP hydrolysis in an initial step coupled with ADP release. In neurons, kinesin-1/KIF5C preferentially binds to the GTP-state microtubules over GDP-state microtubules to selectively enter an axon among many processes; however, because the atomic structure of nucleotide-free KIF5C is unavailable, its molecular mechanism remains unresolved. Here, the crystal structure of nucleotide-free KIF5C and the cryo-electron microscopic structure of nucleotide-free KIF5C complexed with the GTP-state microtubule are presented. The structures illustrate mutual conformational changes induced by interaction between the GTP-state microtubule and KIF5C. KIF5C acquires the 'rigor conformation', where mobile switches I and II are stabilized through L11 and the initial portion of the neck-linker, facilitating effective ADP release and the weak-to-strong transition of KIF5C microtubule affinity. Conformational changes to tubulin strengthen the longitudinal contacts of the GTP-state microtubule in a similar manner to GDP-taxol microtubules. These results and functional analyses provide the molecular mechanism of the preferential binding of KIF5C to GTP-state microtubules.",X-ray and Cryo-EM structures reveal mutual conformational changes of Kinesin and GTP-state microtubules upon binding.,The EMBO journal
25770585,"Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is a post-transcriptional mechanism that targets aberrant transcripts and regulates the cellular RNA reservoir. Genetic modulation in vertebrates suggests that NMD is critical for cellular and tissue homeostasis, although the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here, we generate knockout mice lacking Smg6/Est1, a key nuclease in NMD and a telomerase cofactor. While the complete loss of Smg6 causes mouse lethality at the blastocyst stage, inducible deletion of Smg6 is compatible with embryonic stem cell (ESC) proliferation despite the absence of telomere maintenance and functional NMD. Differentiation of Smg6-deficient ESCs is blocked due to sustained expression of pluripotency genes, normally repressed by NMD, and forced down-regulation of one such target, c-Myc, relieves the differentiation block. Smg6-null embryonic fibroblasts are viable as well, but are refractory to cellular reprograming into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Finally, depletion of all major NMD factors compromises ESC differentiation, thus identifying NMD as a licensing factor for the switch of cell identity in the process of stem cell differentiation and somatic cell reprograming.",Smg6/Est1 licenses embryonic stem cell differentiation via nonsense-mediated mRNA decay.,The EMBO journal

Its activity is inhibited by adverse conditions, including nutrient limitation, hypoxia, and DNA damage. In this study, we demonstrate that Che-1, a RNA polymerase II-binding protein activated by the DNA damage response, inhibits mTOR activity in response to stress conditions. We found that, under stress, Che-1 induces the expression of two important mTOR inhibitors, Redd1 and Deptor, and that this activity is required for sustaining stress-induced autophagy. Strikingly, Che-1 expression correlates with the progression of multiple myeloma and is required for cell growth and survival, a malignancy characterized by high autophagy response.",Che-1-induced inhibition of mTOR pathway enables stress-induced autophagy.,The EMBO journal

Which molecular signals initiate such axonal and synaptic reorganisation in the adult central nervous system is currently unknown. Here, we identify FGF22 as a key regulator of circuit remodeling in the injured spinal cord. We show that FGF22 is produced by spinal relay neurons, while its main receptors FGFR1 and FGFR2 are expressed by cortical projection neurons. FGF22 deficiency or the targeted deletion of FGFR1 and FGFR2 in the hindlimb motor cortex limits the formation of new synapses between corticospinal collaterals and relay neurons, delays their molecular maturation, and impedes functional recovery in a mouse model of spinal cord injury. These results establish FGF22 as a synaptogenic mediator in the adult nervous system and a crucial regulator of synapse formation and maturation during post-injury remodeling in the spinal cord.",FGF22 signaling regulates synapse formation during post-injury remodeling of the spinal cord.,The EMBO journal

To overcome the limitations associated with safety, efficiency, and scalability of traditional iPSC derivation, expansion, and differentiation protocols, biomaterials have recently been considered. Beyond addressing these limitations, the integration of biomaterials with existing iPSC culture platforms could offer additional opportunities to better probe the biology and control the behavior of iPSCs or their progeny in vitro and in vivo. Herein, we discuss the impact of biomaterials on the iPSC field, from derivation to tissue regeneration and modeling.

Chemokines play critical roles in a large number of biological processes and are also involved in a range of pathological conditions. For these reasons, chemokines are at the focus of studies in developmental biology and of clinically oriented research aimed at controlling cancer, inflammation, and immunological diseases. The small size of the zebrafish embryos, their rapid external development, and optical properties as well as the large number of eggs and the fast expansion in genetic tools available make this model an extremely useful one for studying the function of chemokines and chemokine receptors in an in vivo setting. Here, we review the findings relevant to the role that chemokines play in the context of directed single-cell migration, primarily in neutrophils and germ cells, and compare it to the collective cell migration of the zebrafish lateral line.

Here, we show that terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (TdT), a closely related PolX involved in V(D)J recombination, has the same property. We solved its crystal structure with an annealed DNA synapsis containing one micro-homology (MH) base pair and one nascent base pair. This structure reveals how the N-terminal domain and Loop 1 of Tdt cooperate for bridging the two DNA ends, providing a templating base in trans and limiting the MH search region to only two base pairs. A network of ordered water molecules is proposed to assist the incorporation of any nucleotide independently of the in trans templating base. These data are consistent with a recent model that explains the statistics of sequences synthesized in vivo by Tdt based solely on this dinucleotide step.

Studies in breast and skin epithelia indicate that Snail proteins promote an undifferentiated state. Here, we demonstrate that conditional knockout of Snai1 in the intestinal epithelium results in apoptotic loss of crypt base columnar stem cells and bias towards differentiation of secretory lineages. In vitro organoid cultures derived from Snai1 conditional knockout mice also undergo apoptosis when Snai1 is deleted. Conversely, ectopic expression of Snai1 in the intestinal epithelium in vivo results in the expansion of the crypt base columnar cell pool and a decrease in secretory enteroendocrine and Paneth cells. Following conditional deletion of Snai1, the intestinal epithelium fails to produce a proliferative response following radiation-induced damage indicating a fundamental requirement for Snai1 in epithelial regeneration. These results demonstrate that Snai1 is required for regulation of lineage choice, maintenance of CBC stem cells and regeneration of the intestinal epithelium following damage.",Snai1 regulates cell lineage allocation and stem cell maintenance in the mouse intestinal epithelium.,The EMBO journal

To explore the specific in vivo role of LOXL2 in physiological and tumor contexts, we generated conditional gain- and loss-of-function mouse models. Germ-line deletion of Loxl2 promotes lethality in half of newborn mice mainly associated to congenital heart defects, while Loxl2 overexpression triggers male sterility due to epididymal dysfunction caused by epithelial disorganization, fibrosis and acute inflammation. Remarkably, when challenged to chemical skin carcinogenesis, Loxl2-overexpressing mice increased tumor burden and malignant progression, while Loxl2-deficient mice exhibit the opposite phenotypes. Loxl2 levels in premalignant tumors negatively correlate with expression of epidermal differentiation markers and components of the Notch1 pathway. We show that LOXL2 is a direct repressor of NOTCH1. Additionally, we identify an exclusive expression pattern between LOXL2 and members of the canonical NOTCH1 pathway in human HNSCC.

25755250,"The malate-aspartate shuttle is indispensable for the net transfer of cytosolic NADH into mitochondria to maintain a high rate of glycolysis and to support rapid tumor cell growth. The malate-aspartate shuttle is operated by two pairs of enzymes that localize to the mitochondria and cytoplasm, glutamate oxaloacetate transaminases (GOT), and malate dehydrogenases (MDH). Here, we show that mitochondrial GOT2 is acetylated and that deacetylation depends on mitochondrial SIRT3. We have identified that acetylation occurs at three lysine residues, K159, K185, and K404 (3K), and enhances the association between GOT2 and MDH2. The GOT2 acetylation at these three residues promotes the net transfer of cytosolic NADH into mitochondria and changes the mitochondrial NADH/NAD(+) redox state to support ATP production. Additionally, GOT2 3K acetylation stimulates NADPH production to suppress ROS and to protect cells from oxidative damage. Moreover, GOT2 3K acetylation promotes pancreatic cell proliferation and tumor growth in vivo. Finally, we show that GOT2 K159 acetylation is increased in human pancreatic tumors, which correlates with reduced SIRT3 expression.

Inflammation antagonizes this program, resulting in foam cell formation and atherosclerosis; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying this antagonism remain to be fully elucidated. We use promoter enrichment-quantitative mass spectrometry (PE-QMS) to characterize the composition of gene regulatory complexes assembled at the promoter of the lipid transporter Abca1 following downregulation of its expression. We identify a subset of proteins that show LXR ligand- and binding-dependent association with the Abca1 promoter and demonstrate they differentially control Abca1 expression. We determine that NCOA5 is linked to inflammatory Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling and establish that NCOA5 functions as an LXR corepressor to attenuate Abca1 expression. Importantly, TLR3-LXR signal crosstalk promotes recruitment of NCOA5 to the Abca1 promoter together with loss of RNA polymerase II and reduced cholesterol efflux. Together, these data significantly expand our knowledge of regulatory inputs impinging on the Abca1 promoter and indicate a central role for NCOA5 in mediating crosstalk between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory pathways that results in repression of macrophage cholesterol efflux.",An LXR-NCOA5 gene regulatory complex directs inflammatory crosstalk-dependent repression of macrophage cholesterol efflux.,The EMBO journal
25750208,"Primordial germ cells (PGCs) develop only into sperm and oocytes in vivo. The molecular mechanisms underlying human PGC specification are poorly understood due to inaccessibility of cell materials and lack of in vitro models for tracking the earliest stages of germ cell development. Here, we describe a defined and stepwise differentiation system for inducing pre-migratory PGC-like cells (PGCLCs) from human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs). In response to cytokines, PSCs differentiate first into a heterogeneous mesoderm-like cell population and then into PGCLCs, which exhibit minimal PRDM14 expression. PGC specification in humans is similar to the murine process, with the sequential activation of mesodermal and PGC genes, and the suppression of neural induction and of de novo DNA methylation, suggesting that human PGC formation is induced via epigenesis, the process of germ cell specification via inductive signals from surrounding somatic cells. This study demonstrates that PGC commitment in humans shares key features with that of the mouse, but also highlights key differences, including transcriptional regulation during the early stage of human PGC development (3-6 weeks). A more comprehensive understanding of human germ cell development may lead to methodology for successfully generating PSC-derived gametes for reproductive medicine.",Human primordial germ cell commitment in vitro associates with a unique PRDM14 expression profile.,The EMBO journal

Senescence induction leads to the inhibition of self-renewal of tumor cells and blockage of tumor formation and growth. A signaling cascade was identified that acts downstream of Shp2 to counter senescence: Src, focal adhesion kinase, and Map kinase inhibit senescence by activating the expression of S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (Skp2), Aurora kinase A (Aurka), and the Notch ligand Delta-like 1 (Dll1), which block p27 and p53. Remarkably, the expression of Shp2 and of selected target genes predicts human breast cancer outcome.

As microRNAs have important roles in cell fate transitions, we set out to study their function during the glial progenitor cell (GPC) to astrocyte transition. Inducible deletion of all canonical microRNAs in GPCs in vitro led to a block in the differentiation to astrocytes. In an unbiased screen, the reintroduction of let-7 and miR-125 families of microRNAs rescued differentiation. Let-7 and miR-125 shared many targets and functioned in parallel to JAK-STAT signaling, a known regulator of astrogliogenesis. While individual knockdown of shared targets did not rescue the differentiation phenotype in microRNA-deficient GPCs, overexpression of these targets in wild-type GPCs blocked differentiation. This finding supports the idea that microRNAs simultaneously suppress multiple mRNAs that inhibit differentiation. MicroRNA-regulated transcripts exhibited concordant changes during in vivo differentiation and were enriched for a gene set upregulated in glioblastomas, consistent with validity of using the in vitro model to study in vivo events.

In neoplastic cells, however, autophagic responses constitute a means to cope with intracellular and environmental stress, thus favoring tumor progression. This implies that at least in some cases, oncogenesis proceeds along with a temporary inhibition of autophagy or a gain of molecular functions that antagonize its oncosuppressive activity.

Apical beta-heavy Spectrin binds to Ex and co-localises with it at the apical membrane to antagonise Yki activity. Interestingly, in both the ovarian follicular epithelium and intestinal epithelium of Drosophila, apical Spectrins and Crb are dispensable for repression of Yki, while basolateral Spectrins (alpha/beta dimers) are essential. Finally, the Spectrin cytoskeleton is required to regulate the localisation of the Hippo pathway effector YAP in response to cell density human epithelial cells.

Reduced cilia numbers are caused by compromised generation of centrioles at deuterosomes, which serve as major amplification platform for centrioles in MCCs.

25712212,"The ability to study live cells as they progress through the stages of cancer provides the opportunity to discover dynamic networks underlying pathology, markers of early stages, and ways to assess therapeutics. Genetically engineered animal models of cancer, where it is possible to study the consequences of temporal-specific induction of oncogenes or deletion of tumor suppressors, have yielded major insights into cancer progression. Yet differences exist between animal and human cancers, such as in markers of progression and response to therapeutics. Thus, there is a need for human cell models of cancer progression. Most human cell models of cancer are based on tumor cell lines and xenografts of primary tumor cells that resemble the advanced tumor state, from which the cells were derived, and thus do not recapitulate disease progression. Yet a subset of cancer types have been reprogrammed to pluripotency or near-pluripotency by blastocyst injection, by somatic cell nuclear transfer and by induced pluripotent stem cell (iPS) technology. The reprogrammed cancer cells show that pluripotency can transiently dominate over the cancer phenotype. Diverse studies show that reprogrammed cancer cells can, in some cases, exhibit early-stage phenotypes reflective of only partial expression of the cancer genome. In one case, reprogrammed human pancreatic cancer cells have been shown to recapitulate stages of cancer progression, from early to late stages, thus providing a model for studying pancreatic cancer development in human cells where previously such could only be discerned from mouse models.

How PI3P is sensed and used to coordinate the conjugation systems remained unclear. Here, we show that Atg21, a WD40 beta-propeller, binds via PI3P to the preautophagosomal structure (PAS). Atg21 directly interacts with the coiled-coil domain of Atg16 and with Atg8. This latter interaction requires the conserved F5K6-motif in the N-terminal helical domain of Atg8, but not its AIM-binding site.

Substrate ubiquitination acts as the sorting principle determining JUNQ deposition and subsequent degradation. Here, we show that JUNQ unexpectedly resides inside the nucleus, defining a new intranuclear quality control compartment, INQ, for the deposition of both nuclear and cytosolic misfolded proteins, irrespective of ubiquitination. Deposition of misfolded cytosolic proteins at INQ involves chaperone-assisted nuclear import via nuclear pores. The compartment-specific aggregases, Btn2 (nuclear) and Hsp42 (cytosolic), direct protein deposition to nuclear INQ and cytosolic (CytoQ) sites, respectively. Intriguingly, Btn2 is transiently induced by both protein folding stress and DNA replication stress, with DNA surveillance proteins accumulating at INQ. Our data therefore reveal a bipartite, inter-compartmental protein quality control system linked to DNA surveillance via INQ and Btn2.",Compartment-specific aggregases direct distinct nuclear and cytoplasmic aggregate deposition.,The EMBO journal
25666591,"Intestinal immune regulatory signals govern gut homeostasis. Breakdown of such regulatory mechanisms may result in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Lactobacillus acidophilus contains unique surface layer proteins (Slps), including SlpA, SlpB, SlpX, and lipoteichoic acid (LTA), which interact with pattern recognition receptors to mobilize immune responses. Here, to elucidate the role of SlpA in protective immune regulation, the NCK2187 strain, which solely expresses SlpA, was generated. NCK2187 and its purified SlpA bind to the C-type lectin SIGNR3 to exert regulatory signals that result in mitigation of colitis, maintenance of healthy gastrointestinal microbiota, and protected gut mucosal barrier function. However, such protection was not observed in Signr3(-/-) mice, suggesting that the SlpA/SIGNR3 interaction plays a key regulatory role in colitis. Our work presents critical insights into SlpA/SIGNR3-induced responses that are integral to the potential development of novel biological therapies for autoinflammatory diseases, including IBD.",SIGNR3-dependent immune regulation by Lactobacillus acidophilus surface layer protein A in colitis.,The EMBO journal
25652077,"Persistent experience-driven adaptation of brain function is associated with alterations in gene expression patterns, resulting in structural and functional neuronal remodeling. How synaptic activity-in particular presynaptic performance-is coupled to gene expression in nucleus remains incompletely understood. Here, we report on a role of CtBP1, a transcriptional co-repressor enriched in presynapses and nuclei, in the activity-driven reconfiguration of gene expression in neurons. We demonstrate that presynaptic and nuclear pools of CtBP1 are interconnected and that both synaptic retention and shuttling of CtBP1 between cytoplasm and nucleus are co-regulated by neuronal activity. Finally, we show that CtBP1 is targeted and/or anchored to presynapses by direct interaction with the active zone scaffolding proteins Bassoon and Piccolo. This association is regulated by neuronal activity via modulation of cellular NAD/NADH levels and restrains the size of the CtBP1 pool available for nuclear import, thus contributing to the control of activity-dependent gene expression. Our combined results reveal a mechanism for coupling activity-induced molecular rearrangements in the presynapse with reconfiguration of neuronal gene expression.",Synaptic activity controls localization and function of CtBP1 via binding to Bassoon and Piccolo.,The EMBO journal
25637353,"Dendritic cells (DCs) patrol the interstitial space of peripheral tissues. The mechanisms that regulate their migration in such constrained environment remain unknown. We here investigated the role of calcium in immature DCs migrating in confinement. We found that they displayed calcium oscillations that were independent of extracellular calcium and more frequently observed in DCs undergoing strong speed fluctuations. In these cells, calcium spikes were associated with fast motility phases. IP(3) receptors (IP(3)Rs) channels, which allow calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum, were identified as required for immature DCs to migrate at fast speed. The IP(3)R1 isoform was further shown to specifically regulate the locomotion persistence of immature DCs, that is, their capacity to maintain directional migration. This function of IP(3)R1 results from its ability to control the phosphorylation levels of myosin II regulatory light chain (MLC) and the back/front polarization of the motor protein. We propose that by upholding myosin II activity, constitutive calcium release from the ER through IP(3)R1 maintains DC polarity during migration in confinement, facilitating the exploration of their environment.",Space exploration by dendritic cells requires maintenance of myosin II activity by IP3 receptor 1.,The EMBO journal

25630703,"There is an expanding list of examples by which one mRNA can posttranscriptionally influence the expression of others. This can involve RNA sponges that sequester regulatory RNAs of mRNAs in the same regulon, but the underlying molecular mechanism of such mRNA cross talk remains little understood. Here, we report sponge-mediated mRNA cross talk in the posttranscriptional network of GcvB, a conserved Hfq-dependent small RNA with one of the largest regulons known in bacteria. We show that mRNA decay from the gltIJKL locus encoding an amino acid ABC transporter generates a stable fragment (SroC) that base-pairs with GcvB. This interaction triggers the degradation of GcvB by RNase E, alleviating the GcvB-mediated mRNA repression of other amino acid-related transport and metabolic genes. Intriguingly, since the gltIJKL mRNA itself is a target of GcvB, the SroC sponge seems to enable both an internal feed-forward loop to activate its parental mRNA in cis and activation of many trans-encoded mRNAs in the same pathway. Disabling this mRNA cross talk affects bacterial growth when peptides are the sole carbon and nitrogen sources.",Cross talk between ABC transporter mRNAs via a target mRNA-derived sponge of the GcvB small RNA.,The EMBO journal

The spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) plays a central role in the activation of the BCR, but less is known about its contribution to the survival and maintenance of mature B cells. We generated mice with an inducible and B-cell-specific deletion of the Syk gene and found that a considerable fraction of mature Syk-negative B cells can survive in the periphery for an extended time. Syk-negative B cells are defective in BCR, RP105 and CD38 signaling but still respond to an IL-4, anti-CD40, CpG or LPS stimulus. Our in vivo experiments show that Syk-deficient B cells require BAFF receptor and CD19/PI3K signaling for their long-term survival.

25609789,"Aging and carcinogenesis coincide with the accumulation of DNA damage and mutations in stem and progenitor cells. Molecular mechanisms that influence responses of stem and progenitor cells to DNA damage remain to be delineated. Here, we show that niche positioning and Wnt signaling activity modulate the sensitivity of intestinal stem and progenitor cells (ISPCs) to DNA damage. ISPCs at the crypt bottom with high Wnt/beta-catenin activity are more sensitive to DNA damage compared to ISPCs in position 4 with low Wnt activity. These differences are not induced by differences in cell cycle activity but relate to DNA damage-dependent activation of Wnt signaling, which in turn amplifies DNA damage checkpoint activation. The study shows that instructed enhancement of Wnt signaling increases radio-sensitivity of ISPCs, while inhibition of Wnt signaling decreases it. These results provide a proof of concept that cell intrinsic levels of Wnt signaling modulate the sensitivity of ISPCs to DNA damage and heterogeneity in Wnt activation in the stem cell niche contributes to the selection of ISPCs in the context of DNA damage.",Wnt activity and basal niche position sensitize intestinal stem and progenitor cells to DNA damage.,The EMBO journal

The molecular mechanism underlying enhanced glycolysis in PSCs is not clear. Using Dgcr8-/- mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) that lack mature miRNAs, we found that miR-290 cluster of miRNAs stimulates glycolysis by upregulating glycolytic enzymes Pkm2 and Ldha, which are also essential for the induction of pluripotency during reprogramming. Mechanistically, we identified Mbd2, a reader for methylated CpGs, as the target of miR-290 cluster that represses glycolysis and reprogramming. Furthermore, we discovered Myc as a key target of Mbd2 that controls metabolic switch in ESCs. Importantly, we demonstrated that miR-371 cluster, a human homolog of miR-290 cluster, stimulates glycolysis to promote the reprogramming of human fibroblasts. Hence, we identified a previously unappreciated mechanism by which miR-290/371 miRNAs orchestrate epigenetic, transcriptional and metabolic networks to promote pluripotency in PSCs and during reprogramming.",miR-290/371-Mbd2-Myc circuit regulates glycolytic metabolism to promote pluripotency.,The EMBO journal
25603932,"Multi-layered defense responses are activated in plants upon recognition of invading pathogens. Transmembrane receptors recognize conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and activate MAP kinase cascades, which regulate changes in gene expression to produce appropriate immune responses. For example, Arabidopsis MAP kinase 4 (MPK4) regulates the expression of a subset of defense genes via at least one WRKY transcription factor. We report here that MPK4 is found in complexes in vivo with PAT1, a component of the mRNA decapping machinery. PAT1 is also phosphorylated by MPK4 and, upon flagellin PAMP treatment, PAT1 accumulates and localizes to cytoplasmic processing (P) bodies which are sites for mRNA decay. Pat1 mutants exhibit dwarfism and de-repressed immunity dependent on the immune receptor SUMM2. Since mRNA decapping is a critical step in mRNA turnover, linking MPK4 to mRNA decay via PAT1 provides another mechanism by which MPK4 may rapidly instigate immune responses.",The mRNA decay factor PAT1 functions in a pathway including MAP kinase 4 and immune receptor SUMM2.,The EMBO journal
25603931,"Ovarian hormones increase breast cancer risk by poorly understood mechanisms. We assess the role of progesterone on global stem cell function by serially transplanting mouse mammary epithelia. Progesterone receptor (PR) deletion severely reduces the regeneration capacity of the mammary epithelium. The PR target, receptor activator of Nf-kappaB ligand (RANKL), is not required for this function, and the deletion of Wnt4 reduces the mammary regeneration capacity even more than PR ablation. A fluorescent reporter reveals so far undetected perinatal Wnt4 expression that is independent of hormone signaling. Pubertal and adult Wnt4 expression is specific to PR+ luminal cells and requires intact PR signaling. Conditional deletion of Wnt4 reveals that this early, previously unappreciated, Wnt4 expression is functionally important. We provide genetic evidence that canonical Wnt signaling in the myoepithelium required PR and Wnt4, whereas the canonical Wnt signaling activities observed in the embryonic mammary bud and in the stroma around terminal end buds are independent of Wnt4. Thus, progesterone and Wnt4 control stem cell function through a luminal-myoepithelial crosstalk with Wnt4 acting independent of PR perinatally.",Progesterone and Wnt4 control mammary stem cells via myoepithelial crosstalk.,The EMBO journal

However, the processes underlying the loss of tolerance against nuclear self-constituents remain largely unresolved. Using mice deficient in lymphotoxin and Hox11, we report that approximately 25% of mice lacking secondary lymphoid organs spontaneously develop specific antinuclear antibodies. Interestingly, we find this phenotype is not caused by a defect in central tolerance. Rather, cell-specific deletion and in vivo lymphotoxin blockade link these systemic autoimmune responses to the formation of gut-associated lymphoid tissue in the neonatal period of life. We further demonstrate antinuclear antibody production is influenced by the presence of commensal gut flora, in particular increased colonization with segmented filamentous bacteria, and IL-17 receptor signaling. Together, these data indicate that neonatal colonization of gut microbiota influences generalized autoimmunity in adult life.",Commensal microbiota influence systemic autoimmune responses.,The EMBO journal

A number of possible functions of Matrin3 have been suggested, but no widespread role in RNA metabolism has yet been clearly demonstrated. We identified Matrin3 by its interaction with the second RRM domain of the splicing regulator PTB. Using a combination of RNAi knockdown, transcriptome profiling and iCLIP, we find that Matrin3 is a regulator of hundreds of alternative splicing events, principally acting as a splicing repressor with only a small proportion of targeted events being co-regulated by PTB. In contrast to other splicing regulators, Matrin3 binds to an extended region within repressed exons and flanking introns with no sharply defined peaks.

25595798,"P4-ATPases translocate aminophospholipids, such as phosphatidylserine (PS), to the cytosolic leaflet of membranes. PS is highly enriched in recycling endosomes (REs) and is essential for endosomal membrane traffic. Here, we show that PS flipping by an RE-localized P4-ATPase is required for the recruitment of the membrane fission protein EHD1. Depletion of ATP8A1 impaired the asymmetric transbilayer distribution of PS in REs, dissociated EHD1 from REs, and generated aberrant endosomal tubules that appear resistant to fission. EHD1 did not show membrane localization in cells defective in PS synthesis. ATP8A2, a tissue-specific ATP8A1 paralogue, is associated with a neurodegenerative disease (CAMRQ). ATP8A2, but not the disease-causative ATP8A2 mutant, rescued the endosomal defects in ATP8A1-depleted cells. Primary neurons from Atp8a2-/- mice showed a reduced level of transferrin receptors at the cell surface compared to Atp8a2+/+ mice.

25588945,"Lysosomal degradation is essential for the termination of EGF-stimulated EGF receptor (EGFR) signaling. This requires EGFR sorting to the intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) of multi-vesicular endosomes (MVEs). Cytosolic proteins including the ESCRT machineries are key regulators of EGFR intraluminal sorting, but roles for endosomal transmembrane proteins in receptor sorting are poorly defined. Here, we show that LAPTM4B, an endosomal transmembrane oncoprotein, inhibits EGF-induced EGFR intraluminal sorting and lysosomal degradation, leading to enhanced and prolonged EGFR signaling. LAPTM4B blocks EGFR sorting by promoting ubiquitination of Hrs (an ESCRT-0 subunit), which inhibits the Hrs association with ubiquitinated EGFR. This is counteracted by the endosomal PIP kinase, PIPKIgammai5, which directly binds LAPTM4B and neutralizes the inhibitory function of LAPTM4B in EGFR sorting by generating PtdIns(4,5)P2 and recruiting SNX5. PtdIns(4,5)P2 and SNX5 function together to protect Hrs from ubiquitination, thereby promoting EGFR intraluminal sorting. These results reveal an essential layer of EGFR trafficking regulated by LAPTM4B, PtdIns(4,5)P2 signaling, and the ESCRT complex and define a mechanism by which the oncoprotein LAPTM4B can transform cells and promote tumor progression.","LAPTM4B is a PtdIns(4,5)P2 effector that regulates EGFR signaling, lysosomal sorting, and degradation.",The EMBO journal

However, whether this loading also occurs independently of Hsp90 and ATP remains unclear. We show that the Tetrahymena Hsp90 co-chaperone Coi12p promotes siRNA loading into the Argonaute protein Twi1p in both ATP-dependent and ATP-independent manners in vitro. The ATP-dependent activity requires Hsp90 and the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain of Coi12p, whereas these factors are dispensable for the ATP-independent activity. Both activities facilitate siRNA loading by counteracting the Twi1p-binding protein Giw1p, which is important to specifically sort the 26- to 32-nt siRNAs to Twi1p. Although Coi12p lacking its TPR domain does not bind to Hsp90, it can partially restore the siRNA loading and DNA elimination defects of COI12 knockout cells, suggesting that Hsp90- and ATP-independent loading of siRNA occurs in vivo and plays a physiological role in Tetrahymena.",A Tetrahymena Hsp90 co-chaperone promotes siRNA loading by ATP-dependent and ATP-independent mechanisms.,The EMBO journal
25586378,"In mammalian cells, cargo-laden secretory vesicles leave the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) en route to ER-Golgi intermediate compartments (ERGIC) in a manner dependent on the COPII coat complex. We report here that COPII-coated transport carriers traverse a submicron, TFG (Trk-fused gene)-enriched zone at the ER/ERGIC interface. The architecture of TFG complexes as determined by three-dimensional electron microscopy reveals the formation of flexible, octameric cup-like structures, which are able to self-associate to generate larger polymers in vitro. In cells, loss of TFG function dramatically slows protein export from the ER and results in the accumulation of COPII-coated carriers throughout the cytoplasm. Additionally, the tight association between ER and ERGIC membranes is lost in the absence of TFG. We propose that TFG functions at the ER/ERGIC interface to locally concentrate COPII-coated transport carriers and link exit sites on the ER to ERGIC membranes. Our findings provide a new mechanism by which COPII-coated carriers are retained near their site of formation to facilitate rapid fusion with neighboring ERGIC membranes upon uncoating, thereby promoting interorganellar cargo transport.",TFG clusters COPII-coated transport carriers and promotes early secretory pathway organization.,The EMBO journal
25586377,"To obtain mechanistic insights into the cross talk between lipolysis and autophagy, two key metabolic responses to starvation, we screened the autophagy-inducing potential of a panel of fatty acids in human cancer cells. Both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids such as palmitate and oleate, respectively, triggered autophagy, but the underlying molecular mechanisms differed. Oleate, but not palmitate, stimulated an autophagic response that required an intact Golgi apparatus. Conversely, autophagy triggered by palmitate, but not oleate, required AMPK, PKR and JNK1 and involved the activation of the BECN1/PIK3C3 lipid kinase complex. Accordingly, the downregulation of BECN1 and PIK3C3 abolished palmitate-induced, but not oleate-induced, autophagy in human cancer cells. Moreover, Becn1(+/-) mice as well as yeast cells and nematodes lacking the ortholog of human BECN1 mounted an autophagic response to oleate, but not palmitate. Thus, unsaturated fatty acids induce a non-canonical, phylogenetically conserved, autophagic response that in mammalian cells relies on the Golgi apparatus.",Unsaturated fatty acids induce non-canonical autophagy.,The EMBO journal

In particular, we show that NFATc1 drives EMT reprogramming and maintains pancreatic cancer cells in a stem cell-like state through Sox2-dependent transcription of EMT and stemness factors. Intriguingly, NFATc1-Sox2 complex-mediated PDAC dedifferentiation and progression is opposed by antithetical p53-miR200c signaling, and inactivation of the tumor suppressor pathway is essential for tumor dedifferentiation and dissemination both in genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) and human PDAC. Based on these findings, we propose the existence of a hierarchical signaling network regulating PDAC cell plasticity and suggest that the molecular decision between epithelial cell preservation and conversion into a dedifferentiated cancer stem cell-like phenotype depends on opposing levels of p53 and NFATc1 signaling activities.",Antithetical NFATc1-Sox2 and p53-miR200 signaling networks govern pancreatic cancer cell plasticity.,The EMBO journal
25582120,"Loss of telomere protection occurs during physiological cell senescence and ageing, due to attrition of telomeric repeats and insufficient retention of the telomere-binding factor TRF2. Subsequently formed telomere fusions trigger rampant genomic instability leading to cell death or tumorigenesis. Mechanistically, telomere fusions require either the classical non-homologous end-joining (C-NHEJ) pathway dependent on Ku70/80 and LIG4, or the alternative non-homologous end-joining (A-NHEJ), which relies on PARP1 and LIG3. Here, we show that the tumour suppressor BRCA1, together with its interacting partner CtIP, both acting in end resection, also promotes end-joining of uncapped telomeres. BRCA1 and CtIP do not function in the ATM-dependent telomere damage signalling, nor in telomere overhang removal, which are critical for telomere fusions by C-NHEJ. Instead, BRCA1 and CtIP act in the same pathway as LIG3 to promote joining of de-protected telomeres by A-NHEJ. Our work therefore ascribes novel roles for BRCA1 and CtIP in end-processing and fusion reactions at uncapped telomeres, underlining the complexity of DNA repair pathways that act at chromosome ends lacking protective structures. Moreover, A-NHEJ provides a mechanism of previously unanticipated significance in telomere dysfunction-induced genome instability.",BRCA1 and CtIP promote alternative non-homologous end-joining at uncapped telomeres.,The EMBO journal

We report that Arabidopsis homologue of spliceosome disassembly factor NTR1 is required for correct expression and splicing of DOG1, a regulator of seed dormancy. Global splicing analysis in atntr1 mutants revealed a bias for downstream 5' and 3' splice site selection and an enhanced rate of exon skipping. A local reduction in PolII occupancy at misspliced exons and introns in atntr1 mutants suggests that directionality in splice site selection is a manifestation of fast PolII elongation kinetics. In agreement with this model, we found AtNTR1 to bind target genes and co-localise with PolII. A minigene analysis further confirmed that strong alternative splice sites constitute an AtNTR1-dependent transcriptional roadblock. Plants deficient in PolII endonucleolytic cleavage showed opposite effects for splice site choice and PolII occupancy compared to atntr1 mutants, and inhibition of PolII elongation or endonucleolytic cleavage in atntr1 mutant resulted in partial reversal of splicing defects.

25568309,"To proliferate efficiently, cells must co-ordinate division with chromosome segregation. In Bacillus subtilis, the nucleoid occlusion protein Noc binds to specific DNA sequences (NBSs) scattered around the chromosome and helps to protect genomic integrity by coupling the initiation of division to the progression of chromosome replication and segregation. However, how it inhibits division has remained unclear. Here, we demonstrate that Noc associates with the cell membrane via an N-terminal amphipathic helix, which is necessary for function. Importantly, the membrane-binding affinity of this helix is weak and requires the assembly of nucleoprotein complexes, thus establishing a mechanism for DNA-dependent activation of Noc. Furthermore, division inhibition by Noc requires recruitment of NBS DNA to the cell membrane and is dependent on its ability to bind DNA and membrane simultaneously. Indeed, Noc production in a heterologous system is sufficient for recruitment of chromosomal DNA to the membrane. Our results suggest a simple model in which the formation of large membrane-associated nucleoprotein complexes physically occludes assembly of the division machinery.",Nucleoid occlusion protein Noc recruits DNA to the bacterial cell membrane.,The EMBO journal

We discovered that Scl binds to hematopoietic and cardiac enhancers that become epigenetically primed in multipotent cardiovascular mesoderm, to regulate the divergence of hematopoietic and cardiac lineages. Scl does not act as a pioneer factor but rather exploits a pre-established epigenetic landscape. As the blood lineage emerges, Scl binding and active epigenetic modifications are sustained in hematopoietic enhancers, whereas cardiac enhancers are decommissioned by removal of active epigenetic marks. Our data suggest that, rather than recruiting corepressors to enhancers, Scl prevents ectopic cardiogenesis by occupying enhancers that cardiac factors, such as Gata4 and Hand1, use for gene activation. Although hematopoietic Gata factors bind with Scl to both activated and repressed genes, they are dispensable for cardiac repression, but necessary for activating genes that enable hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell development. These results suggest that a unique subset of enhancers in lineage-specific genes that are accessible for regulators of opposing fates during the time of the fate decision provide a platform where the divergence of mutually exclusive fates is orchestrated.",Scl binds to primed enhancers in mesoderm to regulate hematopoietic and cardiac fate divergence.,The EMBO journal

Paradoxically, there is a vast excess of Mcm2-7 relative to ORC assembled onto chromatin in G1. These excess Mcm2-7 complexes exhibit little co-localization with ORC or replication foci and can function as dormant origins. We dissected the mechanisms regulating the assembly and distribution of the Mcm2-7 complex in the Drosophila genome. We found that in the absence of cyclin E/Cdk2 activity, there was a 10-fold decrease in chromatin-associated Mcm2-7 relative to the levels found at the G1/S transition. The minimal amounts of Mcm2-7 loaded in the absence of cyclin E/Cdk2 activity were strictly localized to ORC binding sites. In contrast, cyclin E/Cdk2 activity was required for maximal loading of Mcm2-7 and a dramatic genome-wide reorganization of the distribution of Mcm2-7 that is shaped by active transcription. Thus, increasing cyclin E/Cdk2 activity over the course of G1 is not only critical for Mcm2-7 loading, but also for the distribution of the Mcm2-7 helicase prior to S-phase entry.",Dynamic loading and redistribution of the Mcm2-7 helicase complex through the cell cycle.,The EMBO journal

USP45 associates with ERCC1, a subunit of the DNA repair endonuclease XPF-ERCC1, via a short acidic motif outside of the USP45 catalytic domain. Wild-type USP45, but not a USP45 mutant defective in ERCC1 binding, efficiently deubiquitylates ERCC1 in vitro, and the levels of ubiquitylated ERCC1 are markedly enhanced in USP45 knockout cells. Cells lacking USP45 are hypersensitive specifically to UV irradiation and DNA interstrand cross-links, similar to cells lacking ERCC1. Furthermore, the repair of UV-induced DNA damage is markedly reduced in USP45-deficient cells. ERCC1 translocation to DNA damage-induced subnuclear foci is markedly impaired in USP45 knockout cells, possibly accounting for defective DNA repair. Finally, USP45 localises to sites of DNA damage in a manner dependent on its deubiquitylase activity, but independent of its ability to bind ERCC1-XPF.

Here, we show that THEMIS constitutively associates with the phosphatases SHP1 and SHP2. This complex requires the adapter GRB2, which bridges SHP to THEMIS in a Tyr-phosphorylation-independent fashion. Rather, SHP1 and THEMIS engage with the N-SH3 and C-SH3 domains of GRB2, respectively, a configuration that allows GRB2-SH2 to recruit the complex onto LAT. Consistent with THEMIS-mediated recruitment of SHP to the TCR signalosome, THEMIS knock-down increased TCR-induced CD3-zeta phosphorylation, Erk activation and CD69 expression, but not LCK phosphorylation. This generalized TCR signalling increase led to augmented apoptosis, a phenotype mirrored by SHP1 knock-down. Remarkably, a KI mutation of LCK Ser59, previously suggested to be key in ERK-mediated resistance towards SHP1 negative feedback, did not affect TCR signalling nor ligand discrimination in vivo.

Pol II and AGO6 are absent from perinucleolar foci, where Pol V and AGO4 are co-localized. In the nucleoplasm, AGO4 displays a strong co-localization with Pol II, whereas AGO6 co-localizes with Pol V.

During mammalian corticogenesis, our group has identified a small pool of genes that are transiently downregulated in the switch of neural stem cells to neurogenic division and reinduced in newborn neurons. Among these switch genes, we found Tox, a transcription factor with hitherto uncharacterized roles in the nervous system. Here, we investigated the role of Tox in corticogenesis by characterizing its expression at the tissue, cellular and temporal level. We found that Tox is regulated by calcineurin/Nfat signalling. Moreover, we combined DNA adenine methyltransferase identification (DamID) with deep sequencing to characterize the chromatin binding properties of Tox including its motif and downstream transcriptional targets including Sox2, Tbr2, Prox1 and other key factors. Finally, we manipulated Tox in the developing brain and validated its multiple roles in promoting neural stem cell proliferation and neurite outgrowth of newborn neurons. Our data provide a valuable resource to study the role of Tox in other tissues and highlight a novel key player in brain development.",Tox: a multifunctional transcription factor and novel regulator of mammalian corticogenesis.,The EMBO journal
25527291,"The protein kinase PINK1 was recently shown to phosphorylate ubiquitin (Ub) on Ser65, and phosphoUb activates the E3 ligase Parkin allosterically. Here, we show that PINK1 can phosphorylate every Ub in Ub chains. Moreover, Ser65 phosphorylation alters Ub structure, generating two conformations in solution. A crystal structure of the major conformation resembles Ub but has altered surface properties. NMR reveals a second phosphoUb conformation in which beta5-strand slippage retracts the C-terminal tail by two residues into the Ub core. We further show that phosphoUb has no effect on E1-mediated E2 charging but can affect discharging of E2 enzymes to form polyUb chains. Notably, UBE2R1- (CDC34), UBE2N/UBE2V1- (UBC13/UEV1A), TRAF6- and HOIP-mediated chain assembly is inhibited by phosphoUb. While Lys63-linked poly-phosphoUb is recognized by the TAB2 NZF Ub binding domain (UBD), 10 out of 12 deubiquitinases (DUBs), including USP8, USP15 and USP30, are impaired in hydrolyzing phosphoUb chains. Hence, Ub phosphorylation has repercussions for ubiquitination and deubiquitination cascades beyond Parkin activation and may provide an independent layer of regulation in the Ub system.","Ubiquitin Ser65 phosphorylation affects ubiquitin structure, chain assembly and hydrolysis.",The EMBO journal

Although much is known about microRNAs maintaining ESC state, microRNAs that are responsible for promoting ESC differentiation are less reported. Here, by screening 40 microRNAs pre-selected by their expression patterns and predicted targets in Dgcr8-null ESCs, we identify 14 novel differentiation-associated microRNAs. Among them, miR-27a and miR-24, restrained by c-Myc in ESC, exert their roles of silencing self-renewal through directly targeting several important pluripotency-associated factors, such as Oct4, Foxo1 and Smads. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of all miR-27/24 in ESCs leads to serious deficiency in ESC differentiation in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, depleting of them in mouse embryonic fibroblasts can evidently promote somatic cell reprogramming. Altogether, our findings uncover the essential role of miR-27 and miR-24 in ESC differentiation and also demonstrate novel microRNAs responsible for ESC differentiation.",Functional screen reveals essential roles of miR-27a/24 in differentiation of embryonic stem cells.,The EMBO journal

During embryogenesis in the mouse, it was hypothesized that PRMT5 functions with the master germline determinant BLIMP1 to promote primordial germ cell (PGC) specification. Using a Blimp1-Cre germline conditional knockout, we discovered that Prmt5 has no major role in murine germline specification, or the first global epigenetic reprograming event involving depletion of cytosine methylation from DNA and histone H3 lysine 9 dimethylation from chromatin. Instead, we discovered that PRMT5 functions at the conclusion of PGC reprograming I to promote proliferation, survival and expression of the gonadal germline program as marked by MVH.

Here, we show that PR-SET7 function in the liver is pivotal for maintaining genome integrity. Hepatocyte-specific deletion of PR-SET7 in mouse embryos resulted in G2 phase arrest followed by massive cell death and defect in liver organogenesis. Inactivation at postnatal stages caused cell duplication-dependent hepatocyte necrosis, accompanied by inflammation, fibrosis and compensatory growth induction of neighboring hepatocytes and resident ductal progenitor cells. Prolonged necrotic regenerative cycles coupled with oncogenic STAT3 activation led to the spontaneous development of hepatic tumors composed of cells with cancer stem cell characteristics. These include a capacity to self-renew in culture or in xenografts and the ability to differentiate to phenotypically distinct hepatic cells.

Indeed, aberrant GC action is linked to severe metabolic stress conditions as seen in Cushing's syndrome, GC therapy and certain components of the Metabolic Syndrome, including obesity and insulin resistance. Here, we identify the hepatic induction of the mammalian conserved microRNA (miR)-379/410 genomic cluster as a key component of GC/GR-driven metabolic dysfunction. Particularly, miR-379 was up-regulated in mouse models of hyperglucocorticoidemia and obesity as well as human liver in a GC/GR-dependent manner. Hepatocyte-specific silencing of miR-379 substantially reduced circulating very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)-associated triglyceride (TG) levels in healthy mice and normalized aberrant lipid profiles in metabolically challenged animals, mediated through miR-379 effects on key receptors in hepatic TG re-uptake. As hepatic miR-379 levels were also correlated with GC and TG levels in human obese patients, the identification of a GC/GR-controlled miRNA cluster not only defines a novel layer of hormone-dependent metabolic control but also paves the way to alternative miRNA-based therapeutic approaches in metabolic dysfunction.",microRNA-379 couples glucocorticoid hormones to dysfunctional lipid homeostasis.,The EMBO journal

In this context, mitochondrial respiration, network dynamics, TCA cycle function, and turnover all have the potential to influence reprogramming and differentiation outcomes. Shifts in cellular metabolism affect enzymes that control epigenetic configuration, which impacts chromatin reorganization and gene expression changes during reprogramming and differentiation.

These changes are triggered by activation of the CDK1 kinase and have been studied extensively. In contrast, very little is known of the cell surface changes during cell division. We undertook a quantitative proteomic comparison of cell surface-exposed proteins in human cancer cells that were tightly synchronized in mitosis or interphase. Six hundred and twenty-eight surface and surface-associated proteins in HeLa cells were identified; of these, 27 were significantly enriched at the cell surface in mitosis and 37 in interphase. Using imaging techniques, we confirmed the mitosis-selective cell surface localization of protocadherin PCDH7, a member of a family with anti-adhesive roles in embryos. We show that PCDH7 is required for development of full mitotic rounding pressure at the onset of mitosis.

Aberrant activation of Hedgehog signaling is the result of genetic mutations of pathway components or other Smo-dependent or independent mechanisms, all triggering the downstream effector Gli1. For this reason, understanding the poorly elucidated mechanism of Gli1-mediated transcription allows to identify novel molecules blocking the pathway at a downstream level, representing a critical goal in tumor biology. Here, we clarify the structural requirements of the pathway effector Gli1 for binding to DNA and identify Glabrescione B as the first small molecule binding to Gli1 zinc finger and impairing Gli1 activity by interfering with its interaction with DNA. Remarkably, as a consequence of its robust inhibitory effect on Gli1 activity, Glabrescione B inhibited the growth of Hedgehog-dependent tumor cells in vitro and in vivo as well as the self-renewal ability and clonogenicity of tumor-derived stem cells. The identification of the structural requirements of Gli1/DNA interaction highlights their relevance for pharmacologic interference of Gli signaling.",Gli1/DNA interaction is a druggable target for Hedgehog-dependent tumors.,The EMBO journal
25471072,"Paradoxically, the thymidine kinase (TK) encoded by Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is an extremely inefficient nucleoside kinase, when compared to TKs from related herpesviruses. We now show that KSHV-TK, in contrast to HSV1-TK, associates with the actin cytoskeleton and induces extensive cell contraction followed by membrane blebbing. These dramatic changes in cell morphology depend on the auto-phosphorylation of tyrosines 65, 85 and 120 in the N-terminus of KSHV-TK. Phosphorylation of tyrosines 65/85 and 120 results in an interaction with Crk family proteins and the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3-Kinase, respectively. The interaction of Crk with KSHV-TK leads to tyrosine phoshorylation of this cellular adaptor. Auto-phosphorylation of KSHV-TK also induces a loss of FAK and paxillin from focal adhesions, resulting in activation of RhoA-ROCK signalling to myosin II and cell contraction. In the absence of FAK or paxillin, KSHV-TK has no effect on focal adhesion integrity or cell morphology. Our observations demonstrate that by acting as a tyrosine kinase, KSHV-TK modulates signalling and cell morphology.",KSHV-TK is a tyrosine kinase that disrupts focal adhesions and induces Rho-mediated cell contraction.,The EMBO journal
25468960,"Autophagy is a catabolic process conserved among eukaryotes. Under nutrient starvation, a portion of the cytoplasm is non-selectively sequestered into autophagosomes. Consequently, ribosomes are delivered to the vacuole/lysosome for destruction, but the precise mechanism of autophagic RNA degradation and its physiological implications for cellular metabolism remain unknown. We characterized autophagy-dependent RNA catabolism using a combination of metabolome and molecular biological analyses in yeast. RNA delivered to the vacuole was processed by Rny1, a T2-type ribonuclease, generating 3'-NMPs that were immediately converted to nucleosides by the vacuolar non-specific phosphatase Pho8. In the cytoplasm, these nucleosides were broken down by the nucleosidases Pnp1 and Urh1. Most of the resultant bases were not re-assimilated, but excreted from the cell.

25452498,"The perpetual arms race between bacteria and phage has resulted in the evolution of efficient resistance systems that protect bacteria from phage infection. Such systems, which include the CRISPR-Cas and restriction-modification systems, have proven to be invaluable in the biotechnology and dairy industries. Here, we report on a six-gene cassette in Bacillus cereus which, when integrated into the Bacillus subtilis genome, confers resistance to a broad range of phages, including both virulent and temperate ones. This cassette includes a putative Lon-like protease, an alkaline phosphatase domain protein, a putative RNA-binding protein, a DNA methylase, an ATPase-domain protein, and a protein of unknown function. We denote this novel defense system BREX (Bacteriophage Exclusion) and show that it allows phage adsorption but blocks phage DNA replication. Furthermore, our results suggest that methylation on non-palindromic TAGGAG motifs in the bacterial genome guides self/non-self discrimination and is essential for the defensive function of the BREX system. However, unlike restriction-modification systems, phage DNA does not appear to be cleaved or degraded by BREX, suggesting a novel mechanism of defense. Pan genomic analysis revealed that BREX and BREX-like systems, including the distantly related Pgl system described in Streptomyces coelicolor, are widely distributed in ~10% of all sequenced microbial genomes and can be divided into six coherent subtypes in which the gene composition and order is conserved.

Three specific alleles of the RNAPII core, rpb1-1, rpb1-S751F and rpb9, cause a defect in replication fork progression, compensated for by additional origin firing, as the main action responsible for instability. The transcription elongation defects of rpb1-S751F and rpb9 plus our observation that rpb1-1 causes RNAPII retention on chromatin suggest that RNAPII could participate in facilitating fork progression upon a transcription-replication encounter.

In searching for appropriate stimuli to activate GC-G, we found that its enzymatic activity is directly stimulated by cool temperatures. In this context, it was observed that dimerization/oligomerization of GC-G, a process generally considered as critical for enzymatic activity of GCs, is strongly enhanced by coolness. Moreover, heterologous expression of GC-G in cultured cells rendered these cells responsive to coolness; thus, the protein might be a sensor for cool temperatures. This concept is supported by the observation of substantially reduced coolness-induced response of Grueneberg ganglion neurons and coolness-evoked ultrasonic vocalization in GC-G-deficient mouse pups.

Although corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), produced by parvocellular neurons of the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and released into the portal circulation at the median eminence, is known to prime downstream hormone release, the molecular mechanism regulating phasic CRH release remains poorly understood. Here, we find a cohort of parvocellular cells interspersed with magnocellular PVN neurons expressing secretagogin. Single-cell transcriptome analysis combined with protein interactome profiling identifies secretagogin neurons as a distinct CRH-releasing neuron population reliant on secretagogin's Ca(2+) sensor properties and protein interactions with the vesicular traffic and exocytosis release machineries to liberate this key hypothalamic releasing hormone. Pharmacological tools combined with RNA interference demonstrate that secretagogin's loss of function occludes adrenocorticotropic hormone release from the pituitary and lowers peripheral corticosterone levels in response to acute stress.

We investigated the functional consequences of such aberrantly elevated acetylation of the nuclear receptor FXR as a model. Proteomic studies identified K217 as the FXR acetylation site in diet-induced obese mice. In vivo studies utilizing acetylation-mimic and acetylation-defective K217 mutants and gene expression profiling revealed that FXR acetylation increased proinflammatory gene expression, macrophage infiltration, and liver cytokine and triglyceride levels, impaired insulin signaling, and increased glucose intolerance. Mechanistically, acetylation of FXR blocked its interaction with the SUMO ligase PIASy and inhibited SUMO2 modification at K277, resulting in activation of inflammatory genes. SUMOylation of agonist-activated FXR increased its interaction with NF-kappaB but blocked that with RXRalpha, so that SUMO2-modified FXR was selectively recruited to and trans-repressed inflammatory genes without affecting FXR/RXRalpha target genes.

In contrast to its well-recognized mobilization by proteotoxic stress, little is known about how this powerful adaptive mechanism reacts to other stresses. Surprisingly, we discovered that metabolic stress suppresses the PSR. This suppression is largely mediated through the central metabolic sensor AMPK, which physically interacts with and phosphorylates HSF1 at Ser121. Through AMPK activation, metabolic stress represses HSF1, rendering cells vulnerable to proteotoxic stress. Conversely, proteotoxic stress inactivates AMPK and thereby interferes with the metabolic stress response. Importantly, metformin, a metabolic stressor and popular anti-diabetic drug, inactivates HSF1 and provokes proteotoxic stress within tumor cells, thereby impeding tumor growth. Thus, these findings uncover a novel interplay between the metabolic stress sensor AMPK and the proteotoxic stress sensor HSF1 that profoundly impacts stress resistance, proteostasis, and malignant growth.",Suppression of the HSF1-mediated proteotoxic stress response by the metabolic stress sensor AMPK.,The EMBO journal

Dusp5(-/-) mice have prolonged eosinophil survival and enhanced eosinophil effector functions following infection with the helminth Nippostrongylus brasiliensis. IL-33-activated Dusp5(-/-) eosinophils exhibit increased cellular ERK1/2 activation and BCL-XL expression that results in enhanced eosinophil survival.

In cay1 mutants, the cellular levels of the telomeric factor Rap1 are drastically diminished due to defects in rap1+ pre-mRNA splicing and Rap1 protein stability. cay1 cells accumulate histone H3 acetylated at lysine 9 at telomeres, which become transcriptionally desilenced, are over-elongated by telomerase and cause chromosomal aberrations in the cold. Overexpressing Rap1 in cay1+ deleted cells significantly reverts all telomeric defects. Additionally, cay1 mutants accumulate unprocessed Tf2 retrotransposon RNA through Rap1-independent mechanisms.

25388951,"Transposable elements (TEs) generate mutations and chromosomal instability when active. To repress TE activity, eukaryotic cells evolved mechanisms to both degrade TE mRNAs into small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and modify TE chromatin to epigenetically inhibit transcription. Since the populations of small RNAs that participate in TE post-transcriptional regulation differ from those that establish RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM), the mechanism through which transcriptionally active TEs transition from post-transcriptional RNAi regulation to chromatin level control has remained unclear. We have identified the molecular mechanism of a plant pathway that functions to direct DNA methylation to transcriptionally active TEs. We demonstrated that 21-22 nucleotide (nt) siRNA degradation products from the RNAi of TE mRNAs are directly incorporated into the ARGONAUTE 6 (AGO6) protein and direct AGO6 to TE chromatin to guide its function in RdDM. We find that this pathway functions in reproductive precursor cells to primarily target long centromeric high-copy transcriptionally active TEs for RdDM prior to gametogenesis.

Intriguingly, the formation of such structures seems not to require the cartwheel structure that normally acts as a scaffold for centriole formation, whereas they can retain pericentriolar material and microtubule nucleation activity. Moreover, we find that, upon RBM14 depletion, a part of the ectopic centriolar protein complexes in turn assemble into structures more akin to centrioles, presumably by incorporating HsSAS-6, a cartwheel component, and cause multipolar spindle formation. We further demonstrate that such structures assemble in the cytoplasm even in the presence of pre-existing centrioles.

Here we report that Bak is retrotranslocated from the mitochondria by pro-survival Bcl-2 proteins. Bak is present in the cytosol of human cells and tissues, but low shuttling rates cause predominant mitochondrial Bak localization. Interchanging the membrane anchors of Bax and Bak reverses their subcellular localization compared to the wild-type proteins.

We use phosphoproteome analysis of mitotic exit to identify Cdk targets that are dephosphorylated at the time of cytokinesis. We then apply a new and widely applicable tool to generate conditionally phosphorylated proteins to identify those whose dephosphorylation is required for cytokinesis. This approach identifies Aip1, Ede1 and Inn1 as cytokinetic regulators.

This remodeling attenuates secretion of misfolded, aggregation-prone proteins during ER stress. Through these activities, the UPR has a critical role in preventing the extracellular protein aggregation associated with numerous human diseases. Here, we demonstrate that UPR activation also directly influences extracellular proteostasis through the upregulation and secretion of the ER HSP40 ERdj3/DNAJB11. Secreted ERdj3 binds misfolded proteins in the extracellular space, substoichiometrically inhibits protein aggregation, and attenuates proteotoxicity of disease-associated toxic prion protein. Moreover, ERdj3 can co-secrete with destabilized, aggregation-prone proteins in a stable complex under conditions where ER chaperoning capacity is overwhelmed, preemptively providing extracellular chaperoning of proteotoxic misfolded proteins that evade ER quality control. This regulated co-secretion of ERdj3 with misfolded clients directly links ER and extracellular proteostasis during conditions of ER stress.
